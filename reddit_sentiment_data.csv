Reddit,homelessness,Landlords don’t want you to know there’s an eviction freeze being considered by LA County’s lawmakers TOMORROW TUES OCT 7,"TL;DR: LA County is debating an eviction freeze this Tuesday.
If people in Long Beach and the South Bay email Janice Hahn now and give public comment tomorrow, we have a real shot at getting it passed. 

LA County’s Board of Supervisors meets Tuesday, October 7 to review County Counsel’s report on “options” for an eviction freeze — a policy that could stop landlords from kicking out tenants who are behind on rent while costs, disasters, and enforcement failures pile up. 

Families across the County are struggling through ICE raids, federal state-sanctioned violence on both citizens and immigrants, rent hikes, wildfires, low wages, and disappearing jobs AND this is happening while we’re under a declared State of Emergency on Homelessness.

This isn’t some far-off decision that we can’t influence because Supervisor Janice Hahn represents Long Beach, Wilmington, Carson, San Pedro, and the South Bay.

If the people in her district speak up, there’s a real chance this eviction freeze could move forward and pass.

What’s happening: 
The Board is reviewing options for an eviction-freeze resolution first drafted by tenant organizers from the Los Angeles Tenants Union.

The freeze would pause non-payment and no-fault evictions and give renters time to recover from debt without losing their homes.

This is a test of political will and commitment to vulnerable communities under the County’s homelessness emergency.

Reddit,homelessness,"City of Long Beach Preparing for Upcoming Weather Event, Urges Residents to Take Precautions","Long Beach, CA – The National Weather Service has forecasted a storm system for the Los Angeles/Long Beach region starting Monday evening, Oct. 13 through Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. The storm is forecasted to bring moderate rain and strong wind gusts to Long Beach, with peak wind and intermittent heavy rainfall expected to occur on Tuesday morning. The City of Long Beach is implementing its inclement weather action plans and will be monitoring and addressing major issues as they occur.

The City is advising residents to prepare now, commute safely and avoid flooded roadways and intersections. The City is advising residents in historically vulnerable, low-lying areas of the city, including along the peninsula and Alamitos Bay, to be vigilant and prepare for potential localized flooding, as is customary during these weather systems. Protective berms remain built and fortified in vulnerable beach areas to safeguard residents and property. Residents should call 9-1-1 for emergencies.

**Sandbags and Sand Distribution**  
The City has activated sandbag distribution sites for Long Beach residents now through Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. Long Beach residents can pick up empty sandbags at all Long Beach Fire Department neighborhood [Fire Stations](https://longbeach.gov/fire/about-us/station-locations/). Sand and sandbags are available at the following locations:

* Lifeguard Station located at 72nd Place and Ocean Boulevard
* Fire Station 7 (2295 Elm Ave.)
* Fire Station 12 (1199 Artesia Blvd.)
* Fire Station 13 (2475 Adriatic Ave.)
* Fire Station 14 (off East Paoli Way and East 3rd Street)

Sand and sandbags are available only to Long Beach residents. Residents are required to bring their IDs to pick up a maximum of 10 bags. Residents are advised to bring their own shovel and/or tool when collecting sand. It is recommended that those needing specific assistance with filling sandbags go to the Lifeguard Station at 72nd Place for additional support, available until 6 p.m. today, Oct. 13 and between noon and 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 14.

**Disaster Preparedness**  
In anticipation of this storm, City crews have conducted inspections and performed maintenance to ensure catch basins in flood-prone areas are clear of debris, and pump stations and seawall plugs are functioning.

As part of the City’s [Be Storm Smart](https://longbeach.gov/pages/city-news/storm/) campaign, community members can view storm safety educational resources, including vital information, social media posts and videos offering guidance on storm preparedness and general emergency awareness best practices, by visiting [longbeach.gov/LBRain](https://longbeach.gov/LBRain) and by following the City social media pages at u/LongBeachCity and #LBRain and #BeStormSmart.

**Homelessness Outreach**  
Long Beach Fire Marine Safety Swift Water Rescue team members are conducting patrols beginning at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 14 along the riverbeds to advise people experiencing homelessness of the potential for fast rising and dangerous waters. 

On Tuesday, Oct. 14, people experiencing homelessness can seek temporary shelter from the rain at the Multi-Service Center (MSC), located at 1301 W. 12th St., during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.). If heavy rain continues beyond the morning, the MSC will temporarily expand operations and remain open through lunch (noon to 1p.m.) and may stay open after 4 p.m. until the rain subsides or until 8 p.m., whichever comes first.

If you are experiencing homelessness, or know someone who is, and want more information about available sheltering options and to stay updated about the Multi-Service Center’s hours during the weather event, the City is providing regular updates at this time through the City’s text alert system related to homelessness.

People should avoid all ocean water contact for at least 72 hours after rainfall.
* Avoid driving through a flooded road or walking across a flowing stream of water. Watch this storm ready [safety video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTBIBUumQTk&feature=youtu.be) for safety tips while driving in flooded areas.
* Slow down at intersections, especially if signal lights are not working, and treat them as stop signs. Be cautious while driving, especially at night.

* Avoid unnecessary trips. If you must travel during the storm, dress in warm, loose layers of clothing. Advise others of your destination and estimated arrival time.
* Be aware of utility workers working in or near the road.
* Stay off sand berms and stay away from City vehicles and machinery operating along the coastline.
* Keep pets inside and ensure they have shelter from the storm.
* Place refuse and recycling carts on the parkway or driveway apron.
* Report street flooding or downed trees by calling 562.570.2700.
* Report downed power lines by calling 9-1-1.

Reddit,parking,Belmont Heights racist or what?,"Was sitting there on 4th Street eating my lunch from Popeyes and admiring Temple Israel's makeshift Sukkah from outside. Was on my phone watching vids and texting normally for a few moments after my meal. Have a disabled placed and parked in the shade. 

Lady across the street audibly calls 911, give my vehicle description, and my clothing description (bright pink shirt btw). She says I'm scoping out the neighborhood looking to steal shit. 

I had been ignoring her for the most part, she was smoking like a chimney as if she was pissed about something, so maybe she was angry I was parked across the street from her house and wouldn't leave, as she happened to be right next to the shul. I flashed her a glance like ""wtf"" and she gave me an evil staredown then went back into her home.

I called LBPD myself and told them what's going on, what I'm doing and everything. A unit swung by anyways, cop hopped out and said ""you're doing nothing wrong. Code 4, let's go"". Cop disappeared as fast as they responded.

Was sitting there on 4th Street eating my lunch from Popeyes and admiring Temple Israel's makeshift Sukkah from outside. Was on my phone watching vids and texting normally for a few moments after my meal. Have a disabled placed and parked in the shade. 

Lady across the street audibly calls 911, give my vehicle description, and my clothing description (bright pink shirt btw). She says I'm scoping out the neighborhood looking to steal shit. 

I had been ignoring her for the most part, she was smoking like a chimney as if she was pissed about something, so maybe she was angry I was parked across the street from her house and wouldn't leave, as she happened to be right next to the shul. I flashed her a glance like ""wtf"" and she gave me an evil staredown then went back into her home.

I called LBPD myself and told them what's going on, what I'm doing and everything. A unit swung by anyways, cop hopped out and said ""you're doing nothing wrong. Code 4, let's go"". Cop disappeared as fast as they responded.

Reddit,parking,Meet the HOA no one asked,"We live in mixed density neighborhood in Long Beach, and our next-door neighbors have decided they’re the self-appointed parking police.

They have a garage and a driveway big enough for four cars… yet somehow all their cars live on the street. They “save” the curb in front of their house by blocking it off AND anyone (especially apartment residents from down the street) parks there, they call a tow truck.

They actually say things like, “those apartment people shouldn’t park here.”
Newsflash: it’s a public street.

The cherry on top? Their cars have out-of-state plates. ARIZONA come get your people. 

I’m trying to figure out:
	•	Who do  we even call about this? Code enforcement? Parking enforcement? 
( we don’t call the police ) 
	•	Can they legally tow people from a public street? (Feels super sketchy.)
	•	And is there any way to report them for hoarding street parking or calling in fake tow claims?

Reddit,parking,At home Euthanasia,"Yesterday we said Goodbye to our Bernadette. She was 16 and in January was diagnosed with a MCT on her liver. Because of her age, heart murmur and cost we decided to give her the best life possible after consulting with our vet. This past week she got so sick. Was barely eating or drinking water, and she had this look in her eye. So we knew it was time. She only wanted chicken so her last dinner and breakfast consisted of a rotisserie chicken. Yesterday we took her to the park and beach. She loved chasing squirrels and she mustered up the strength to chase after two squirrels. But she was tired. We took her to Rosie’s and normally she would run up and down the beach. This time she just stood there. She did try to dig a little. But she didn’t have it in her. Her appointment was at 3pm so we brought her home, gave her a bath and took her to the groomer to get her nails trimmed and we asked to put a bow in her hair. We laid out a blanket with some of our cloths in our 2nd bdrm which we called Bernie’s room. She got up from her blanket and laid on the clothes. We laid down with her comforting her and telling her how much we loved her and how she was such a good girl. The doctor came promptly at 3 and the whole process took about 30m. We used Laps of Love and I can that her transitioning at home was the only option we considered and we’re both glad we did. Dr. B Ankone was so professional, compassionate and reassuring. We don’t think she would have made it through the night. The life in her eyes was fading. She lets us know that Bernie wasn’t in pain but uncomfortable due to the size of belly. Hence her laying on her stomach. My husband and I both cried while I held her paw and he sang to her and caressed her head. She passed peacefully and quickly surrounded by her dads and surviving sister. If you can afford it and you need to make a decision about your fur baby definitely consider laps of love and doing it at home. The comfort in knowing she was at peace and in a familiar place was priceless. Also thank you Dr. Alyssa at pine animal hospital for always taking care of her and checking in on her. You and the staff there always made her feel comfortable when she came in for an appointment. We’ll miss you Bernadette.

Reddit,parking,Hey Long Beach! Future resident here looking for apartment advice!,"Hi everyone,

My husband and I will be moving to Long Beach next year as an expat for work, and I’d be so grateful for any local advice or insight you can share.  

I’m hoping to find a place that feels comfortable, as safe as possible, and convenient. Ideally, I’d love somewhere with walkable access to daily amenities and a well-managed community.  


**Apartments I’m currently considering (all near Downtown LB):**

1. Onni East Village (333 E Broadway)

2. Aster (250 E Broadway)

3. IMT Gallery 421 (421 W Broadway)

 4. AMLI Park Broadway (245 W Broadway)

5. The Crest (207 E Seaside Way)

6. Pine at 6th (555 Pine Ave)

7. RESA (400 W Ocean Blvd)

 



**A little more about me and what I’m looking for:**

1. Budget: up to $3,000 per month

2. Unit type: 1 bedroom

3. Work: My office is near Downtown Long Beach. I’m planning to commute by bike most of the time and only use a car when I need to go to the airport or travel farther away.

4. Groceries: I really value being able to walk to grocery stores or markets

5. Lifestyle: I love Pilates and yoga, so it would be wonderful to be near a good studio or fitness center

6. Safety: I’ve heard different opinions about Downtown Long Beach. While I understand the concerns, I also don’t feel completely at ease in areas like Bixby Knolls, Belmont Shore, or Belmont Heights. The houses there tend to be lower and more open, which feels a bit less secure to me.  I’d feel more comfortable in a modern apartment building with good security and a friendly sense of community.



If anyone has personal experiences or thoughts about these buildings or neighborhoods, I’d really appreciate hearing your perspective.

Reddit,parking,"City of Long Beach Preparing for Upcoming Weather Event, Urges Residents to Take Precautions","Long Beach, CA – The National Weather Service has forecasted a storm system for the Los Angeles/Long Beach region starting Monday evening, Oct. 13 through Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. The storm is forecasted to bring moderate rain and strong wind gusts to Long Beach, with peak wind and intermittent heavy rainfall expected to occur on Tuesday morning. The City of Long Beach is implementing its inclement weather action plans and will be monitoring and addressing major issues as they occur.

The City is advising residents to prepare now, commute safely and avoid flooded roadways and intersections. The City is advising residents in historically vulnerable, low-lying areas of the city, including along the peninsula and Alamitos Bay, to be vigilant and prepare for potential localized flooding, as is customary during these weather systems. Protective berms remain built and fortified in vulnerable beach areas to safeguard residents and property. Residents should call 9-1-1 for emergencies.

**Sandbags and Sand Distribution**  
The City has activated sandbag distribution sites for Long Beach residents now through Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. Long Beach residents can pick up empty sandbags at all Long Beach Fire Department neighborhood [Fire Stations](https://longbeach.gov/fire/about-us/station-locations/). Sand and sandbags are available at the following locations:

* Lifeguard Station located at 72nd Place and Ocean Boulevard
* Fire Station 7 (2295 Elm Ave.)
* Fire Station 12 (1199 Artesia Blvd.)
* Fire Station 13 (2475 Adriatic Ave.)
* Fire Station 14 (off East Paoli Way and East 3rd Street)

Sand and sandbags are available only to Long Beach residents. Residents are required to bring their IDs to pick up a maximum of 10 bags. Residents are advised to bring their own shovel and/or tool when collecting sand. It is recommended that those needing specific assistance with filling sandbags go to the Lifeguard Station at 72nd Place for additional support, available until 6 p.m. today, Oct. 13 and between noon and 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 14. People can also watch this [safety video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fa8ApB_TFc) for tips on how to properly fill sandbags.

**Disaster Preparedness**  
In anticipation of this storm, City crews have conducted inspections and performed maintenance to ensure catch basins in flood-prone areas are clear of debris, and pump stations and seawall plugs are functioning.

As part of the City’s [Be Storm Smart](https://longbeach.gov/pages/city-news/storm/) campaign, community members can view storm safety educational resources, including vital information, social media posts and videos offering guidance on storm preparedness and general emergency awareness best practices, by visiting [longbeach.gov/LBRain](https://longbeach.gov/LBRain) and by following the City social media pages at u/LongBeachCity and #LBRain and #BeStormSmart.

**Homelessness Outreach**  
Long Beach Fire Marine Safety Swift Water Rescue team members are conducting patrols beginning at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 14 along the riverbeds to advise people experiencing homelessness of the potential for fast rising and dangerous waters. 

On Tuesday, Oct. 14, people experiencing homelessness can seek temporary shelter from the rain at the Multi-Service Center (MSC), located at 1301 W. 12th St., during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.).

The storm is forecasted to bring moderate rain and strong wind gusts to Long Beach, with peak wind and intermittent heavy rainfall expected to occur on Tuesday morning. The City of Long Beach is implementing its inclement weather action plans and will be monitoring and addressing major issues as they occur.

The City is advising residents to prepare now, commute safely and avoid flooded roadways and intersections. The City is advising residents in historically vulnerable, low-lying areas of the city, including along the peninsula and Alamitos Bay, to be vigilant and prepare for potential localized flooding, as is customary during these weather systems. Protective berms remain built and fortified in vulnerable beach areas to safeguard residents and property. Residents should call 9-1-1 for emergencies.

**Sandbags and Sand Distribution**  
The City has activated sandbag distribution sites for Long Beach residents now through Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. Long Beach residents can pick up empty sandbags at all Long Beach Fire Department neighborhood [Fire Stations](https://longbeach.gov/fire/about-us/station-locations/). Sand and sandbags are available at the following locations:

* Lifeguard Station located at 72nd Place and Ocean Boulevard
* Fire Station 7 (2295 Elm Ave.)
* Fire Station 12 (1199 Artesia Blvd.)
* Fire Station 13 (2475 Adriatic Ave.)
* Fire Station 14 (off East Paoli Way and East 3rd Street)

Sand and sandbags are available only to Long Beach residents. Residents are required to bring their IDs to pick up a maximum of 10 bags. Residents are advised to bring their own shovel and/or tool when collecting sand. It is recommended that those needing specific assistance with filling sandbags go to the Lifeguard Station at 72nd Place for additional support, available until 6 p.m. today, Oct. 13 and between noon and 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 14. People can also watch this [safety video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fa8ApB_TFc) for tips on how to properly fill sandbags.

**Disaster Preparedness**  
In anticipation of this storm, City crews have conducted inspections and performed maintenance to ensure catch basins in flood-prone areas are clear of debris, and pump stations and seawall plugs are functioning.

As part of the City’s [Be Storm Smart](https://longbeach.gov/pages/city-news/storm/) campaign, community members can view storm safety educational resources, including vital information, social media posts and videos offering guidance on storm preparedness and general emergency awareness best practices, by visiting [longbeach.gov/LBRain](https://longbeach.gov/LBRain) and by following the City social media pages at u/LongBeachCity and #LBRain and #BeStormSmart.

**Homelessness Outreach**  
Long Beach Fire Marine Safety Swift Water Rescue team members are conducting patrols beginning at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 14 along the riverbeds to advise people experiencing homelessness of the potential for fast rising and dangerous waters. 

On Tuesday, Oct. 14, people experiencing homelessness can seek temporary shelter from the rain at the Multi-Service Center (MSC), located at 1301 W. 12th St., during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.). If heavy rain continues beyond the morning, the MSC will temporarily expand operations and remain open through lunch (noon to 1p.m.) and may stay open after 4 p.m. until the rain subsides or until 8 p.m., whichever comes first.

If you are experiencing homelessness, or know someone who is, and want more information about available sheltering options and to stay updated about the Multi-Service Center’s hours during the weather event, the City is providing regular updates at this time through the City’s text alert system related to homelessness.

Reddit,parking,Horny Corner takeover. The last one!,"It’s finally here, the last free(99) drop of the season. 
Which can only mean one thing…
The movie is coming out,  in 6 days!
And will be available on VOD through the site Elprimobrand.com
For now, there’s a couple teasers on the site and a soundtrack link.
And speaking of the soundtrack,  I was able to get the cassette tapes copied and made, and every drop box out today had a cassette tape-soundtrack made just for you. 

What is this guy even talking about?
After yeeeeaaars of playing the “game,” and essentially `just waiting for some rich folks to see me on the street and say “Hey aren’t out that guy with a script?” In this scenario, I would kindly nod yes and they would hand me a check for millions of dollars and I would get to make my first movie, didn’t happen. 
Long story short, life, kids, frustration, deaths, all that good stuff, it was time, I had to make a movie no matter what, so went back to my vault of scripts I had written over the years, found one that I could make for nothing. Got an amazing cast together, and shot a movie on my iPhone in 5 days and with a budget of $938
Now just 5 months later, it’s going to premiere. 
And I hand it over to the public to see. 

This is where these drops and boxes come in. 
There was no budget for the movie, there’s definitely no budget to market this thing, and especially no budget to avert eyeballs for, Netflix or Amazon over to my website. 
So I go back to my Long Beach DIY roots, channeling my senior year at Wilson, wayyyy back when, screen printing t shirts and clothing for everyone out of the back door during “bathroom breaks.” 
Everything’s designed, printed, boxed up, etc here in the garage. 
Filling these boxes, with the big green label (no label, not primo), up with merch, tapes, stickers, etc, and spreading them throughout the local community to bolster some real grass roots support. Oh, ya! Also. Trapt clothing hooked us up and put some plushie pillows in some of these boxes this looking. 
Alright. 
Go get the box! First to find, first to take home. 

So what is this movie about? 
The logline 👇🏽
Reggie’s broke, Mark’s reckless. One Long Beach day explodes when a betrayed husband and two dealer brothers crash their Tinder meet-up, changing six strangers’ lives forever.

Starring Tony Vinci , Lamont Oakley, Richard Ras1 Smith (LB Dub all stars, shortbus), Greg Mudd Lowther (Falling idols, Long Beach records, perro bravo, Hamapple) and Tricia Cruz (mtv, Beverly Hills 90210) 

It’s a Long Beach affair.

This has been a long road.
