We would also feed him and give him money here and there. The first couple of months were great, but these last few weeks things took a turn for the worst, he had an alcoholic fit and destroyed a bunch of glass bottles and mirrors and they were all over our outdoor back area, this was my final straw with him and I lost my temper and we had a screaming match where he threatened to kill me and throw a brick through my windshield. We kicked him off the property but his dilapidated RV is still there. I called the police and made a report to have him 5150’d and arrested. I’m in contact with his mom and twin brother and they’re going to work with us to remove the RV off the property, they’ve been through this so many times with him and they said they’re surprised he lasted as long as he did with us.

Reddit,homelessness,Landlords don’t want you to know there’s an eviction freeze being considered by LA County’s lawmakers TOMORROW TUES OCT 7,"TL;DR: LA County is debating an eviction freeze this Tuesday.
If people in Long Beach and the South Bay email Janice Hahn now and give public comment tomorrow, we have a real shot at getting it passed. 

LA County’s Board of Supervisors meets Tuesday, October 7 to review County Counsel’s report on “options” for an eviction freeze — a policy that could stop landlords from kicking out tenants who are behind on rent while costs, disasters, and enforcement failures pile up. 

Families across the County are struggling through ICE raids, federal state-sanctioned violence on both citizens and immigrants, rent hikes, wildfires, low wages, and disappearing jobs AND this is happening while we’re under a declared State of Emergency on Homelessness.

This isn’t some far-off decision that we can’t influence because Supervisor Janice Hahn represents Long Beach, Wilmington, Carson, San Pedro, and the South Bay.

If the people in her district speak up, there’s a real chance this eviction freeze could move forward and pass.

What’s happening: 
The Board is reviewing options for an eviction-freeze resolution first drafted by tenant organizers from the Los Angeles Tenants Union.

The freeze would pause non-payment and no-fault evictions and give renters time to recover from debt without losing their homes.

This is a test of political will and commitment to vulnerable communities under the County’s homelessness emergency.

Reddit,homelessness,Creep Alert on Ocean Blvd in DTLB,"Hi, this is my first post after being a longtime lurker so apologies if I’m doing anything wrong. 

Just a heads up, there’s a guy on a bicycle on Ocean Blvd in DTLB who’s circling, harassing and calling women names. Young guy, maybe early 20s, ~5’8, skinny, black, short hair, sunglasses, gray hoodie. As I came out of my office building I saw him harass this woman walking westward towards Pine Ave, calling her all sorts of names while she was just minding her own business. I walked up to her and offered to walk with her (i’m a woman myself) and then he started circling the both of us, calling us names but we kept chatting and walking as he sort of stayed behind and was just yelling at us until she got to her destination and I skipped to Broadway and got on a bus. 

The guy didn’t look homeless (although I know you can’t tell by appearance alone) or seemed to be drunk/on drugs, he more-so just had loser incel vibes tbh. I haven’t witnessed or experienced aggressive harassment like this in years and I’m in DTLB almost every day.

The first few times i figured it was cold looking for somewhere to keep warm, once they stole a case of redbull, last night a red suit case and a bunch of clothes which they are several years old, which doesn’t excuse the thievery!

Reddit,homelessness,A dog is in recovery after being stabbed while protecting its owner,"A trail of blood lined the sidewalk of Orange Avenue near Fourth Street early Saturday morning after a man stabbed a dog after protecting its owner and other others.

A man, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was awoken by shouting and then recorded the incident. He said a group of unhoused people were standing on the sidewalk near his building at 333 Orange Ave. when they were approached by another man who also lives in the building.

The suspect was angry that the unhoused people were near his building, the witness said, who spoke with the victims after the incident.

“The dog is barking, the suspect is yelling and shouting, the homeless people are trying to get away from him,” the man said. “The suspect is yelling that homeless people should ‘get a job.’”

The witness said the suspect was approaching the group with a large knife when the people lost hold of the dog’s leash. The dog, a pit bull named Mazzlyn, then protected its owner by attacking the man, who swiped at the dog multiple times with the knife, video shows.

The suspect then fled in a car with another driver, the witness said, adding that he took a picture of the license plate, which he provided to police.

The Long Beach Police Department confirmed officers were dispatched to the area just before 2:30 a.m. Saturday morning after reports of the stabbing. The investigation is ongoing, according to the department.

“We encourage anyone with information regarding this incident to contact non-emergency dispatch at 562-435-6711,” officer Eric Stachura said in an email Wednesday.

Reddit,homelessness,"City of Long Beach Preparing for Upcoming Weather Event, Urges Residents to Take Precautions","Long Beach, CA – The National Weather Service has forecasted a storm system for the Los Angeles/Long Beach region starting Monday evening, Oct. 13 through Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. The storm is forecasted to bring moderate rain and strong wind gusts to Long Beach, with peak wind and intermittent heavy rainfall expected to occur on Tuesday morning. The City of Long Beach is implementing its inclement weather action plans and will be monitoring and addressing major issues as they occur.

The City is advising residents to prepare now, commute safely and avoid flooded roadways and intersections. The City is advising residents in historically vulnerable, low-lying areas of the city, including along the peninsula and Alamitos Bay, to be vigilant and prepare for potential localized flooding, as is customary during these weather systems. Protective berms remain built and fortified in vulnerable beach areas to safeguard residents and property. Residents should call 9-1-1 for emergencies.

**Sandbags and Sand Distribution**  
The City has activated sandbag distribution sites for Long Beach residents now through Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2025. Long Beach residents can pick up empty sandbags at all Long Beach Fire Department neighborhood [Fire Stations](https://longbeach.gov/fire/about-us/station-locations/). Sand and sandbags are available at the following locations:

* Lifeguard Station located at 72nd Place and Ocean Boulevard
* Fire Station 7 (2295 Elm Ave.)
* Fire Station 12 (1199 Artesia Blvd.)
* Fire Station 13 (2475 Adriatic Ave.)
* Fire Station 14 (off East Paoli Way and East 3rd Street)

Sand and sandbags are available only to Long Beach residents. Residents are required to bring their IDs to pick up a maximum of 10 bags. Residents are advised to bring their own shovel and/or tool when collecting sand. It is recommended that those needing specific assistance with filling sandbags go to the Lifeguard Station at 72nd Place for additional support, available until 6 p.m. today, Oct. 13 and between noon and 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 14. People can also watch this [safety video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fa8ApB_TFc) for tips on how to properly fill sandbags.

**Disaster Preparedness**  
In anticipation of this storm, City crews have conducted inspections and performed maintenance to ensure catch basins in flood-prone areas are clear of debris, and pump stations and seawall plugs are functioning.

As part of the City’s [Be Storm Smart](https://longbeach.gov/pages/city-news/storm/) campaign, community members can view storm safety educational resources, including vital information, social media posts and videos offering guidance on storm preparedness and general emergency awareness best practices, by visiting [longbeach.gov/LBRain](https://longbeach.gov/LBRain) and by following the City social media pages at u/LongBeachCity and #LBRain and #BeStormSmart.

**Homelessness Outreach**  
Long Beach Fire Marine Safety Swift Water Rescue team members are conducting patrols beginning at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 14 along the riverbeds to advise people experiencing homelessness of the potential for fast rising and dangerous waters. 

On Tuesday, Oct. 14, people experiencing homelessness can seek temporary shelter from the rain at the Multi-Service Center (MSC), located at 1301 W. 12th St., during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.). If heavy rain continues beyond the morning, the MSC will temporarily expand operations and remain open through lunch (noon to 1p.m.) and may stay open after 4 p.m. until the rain subsides or until 8 p.m., whichever comes first.

If you are experiencing homelessness, or know someone who is, and want more information about available sheltering options and to stay updated about the Multi-Service Center’s hours during the weather event, the City is providing regular updates at this time through the City’s text alert system related to homelessness.

People should avoid all ocean water contact for at least 72 hours after rainfall.
* Avoid driving through a flooded road or walking across a flowing stream of water. Watch this storm ready [safety video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTBIBUumQTk&feature=youtu.be) for safety tips while driving in flooded areas.

* Avoid unnecessary trips. If you must travel during the storm, dress in warm, loose layers of clothing. Advise others of your destination and estimated arrival time.
* Be aware of utility workers working in or near the road.
* Stay off sand berms and stay away from City vehicles and machinery operating along the coastline.
* Keep pets inside and ensure they have shelter from the storm.
* Place refuse and recycling carts on the parkway or driveway apron.

Reddit,homelessness,How Things Are Going With Long Beach's More Aggressive Enforcement Against Encampments,"Nearly a year ago, the U.S. Supreme Court sided 6-3 with the city of Grants Pass, Ore., and ruled that local governments can enforce bans on sleeping outside in public regardless of whether shelter is available. 

In that time, Long Beach — with an anti-camping strategy it adopted in August — has scaled up its citations and arrests, along with outreach and diversion programs, to move people from homeless encampments that block public access to parks, libraries and beaches. 

On Tuesday, the City Council will review how the past nine months have fared under this strategy.

Some numbers they’ll consider: Between June 28, 2024, and Feb. 28, 2025, the city received nearly 4,000 calls about homeless encampments. On those calls, outreach workers enrolled more than 1,400 people into an emergency shelter or transitional housing and moved 416 into permanent homes. In that same time, crews with Long Beach Public Works cleared more than 2,000 encampments, removing 580 tons of garbage. 

Law enforcement also issued 346 citations for camping in public right-of-ways, or for loitering after hours in parks or on beaches citywide, a 22% increase since the Grants Pass decision, according to the City Prosecutor’s Office.

Nearly half (161) of those citations were in four “Priority Focus Areas” at Billie Jean King Library/Lincoln Park, Veterans Park, Jenni Rivera Park and Gumbiner Park.

Most attention was placed on Billie Jean King Library and Lincoln Park, where a higher concentration of homeless pitch tents or roll out sleeping bags under the library’s eaves or under the rear canopy that extends toward the park; and Veterans Park, which had the highest number of citations or arrests in the eight-month period. 

Even as citations are increasing, more people are being diverted from jail or court into recuperative programs, according to the City Prosecutor’s Office. There have been 13 people monthly since the ruling, as opposed to an average of two per month in the year prior. More people also accepted housing in the same time frame, the office reported. 

Of the few tangible next steps outlined in the city’s presentation, officials said Long Beach simply needs more housing for the homeless, as demand outweighs supply and doubt hangs over the future of further funding from the state and federal government. 

There are “hundreds of people at any point who have expressed interest in shelter and are awaiting availability,” according to the city.

Public shelters currently run at 98% capacity, while interim housing programs see 97% occupancy with “only a few beds” turning over each day, according to city data. People wait an average of nearly 50 days from the time they accept shelter to the point they’re given a bed.

Starting this summer, Long Beach will commence a $17.4 million plan — using $11 million in state funding — to tackle the longstanding encampments along the city’s cut of the LA River. The city has built out space for 450 shelter beds in four years, with room for another 100 beds to be available in the next year. 

Otherwise, it’s a light week for local governance, Long Beach. And almost all of it falls on Tuesday. 

It starts at 2 p.m. that day, with the Long Beach Intergovernmental Affairs Committee’s discussion on lobbying priorities ahead of their trip to Washington, D.C., from June 4 to 6. 

Ninety minutes later, the three-member city council committee for arts, culture and tourism will hear a presentation on the proposed expansion of the Percent for the Arts Program, which funds public art installations and live performances. Another presentation at the meeting will provide updates on city preparations for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. 

Following a closed session, the Long Beach City Council will convene for the regular 5 p.m. meeting. Council members will hear, among other items, a second update on implementation of its sidewalk vending ordinance, a three-year, $36 million contract for as-needed hazardous materials testing, and budget cuts made to the 2025 Fiscal Year.

* My partner is willing to pick me up at the Metro A Line in Downtown Long Beach after work, so we can drive together to our apartment in Orange County. 


Couple questions:
1. Does anyone have any tips for taking the Metro frequently?
   1. Should I look into getting a Metro pass?
2. Is the metro clean/punctual? Any apps for tracking the buses easier?
3. I usually carry a taser and/or emergency alarm for when I go on walks just for protection. I plan on bringing this on the bus as well for the same reason, but would you guys consider the Metro or these specific lines unsafe/filled with homeless people often?

Reddit,homelessness,"Fighting eviction in Long Beach, CA — trying to stay housed while paying down rent and employed","Hi everyone,
I’m reaching out during one of the most stressful times of my life. I live in Long Beach, CA and I recently received a 60-day notice to move out by June 16th. I’ve been working with the leasing office to pay down my balance through a weekly $350 plan, but out of nowhere, I was hit with a 3-day notice to pay the full $3,350 or be evicted early—despite having already made a payment and communicating my situation.

Why I’m behind:

My job at Milagros Cinemas didn’t schedule me at all for February, which severely impacted my income.

I was denied my IRS hardship refund—even though I documented my situation and was facing eviction.

I’m actively looking to add a second job with overnight shifts, but I can’t even afford the cost of a guard card to qualify.


I’ve already paid $350 and plan to pay another $700 next week, which will lower my balance to around $2,300. I’m asking for any help to keep me housed, catch up on rent, and finally secure that guard card so I can increase my income and not be in this position again.

If you can help—or even share—my GoFundMe, I’d be deeply grateful:

# California’s $23 Billion Plan to Restore Federal Cuts to Scientific Research

Democrats are calling for the creation of a state equivalent of the National Institutes of Health, but first state lawmakers and then voters would need to approve it.

  
Sept. 13, 2025, 12:41 a.m. ET

Democratic lawmakers in California want the state to restore funding for scientific research that has been slashed by the Trump administration, creating an ambitious plan to use tens of billions of dollars in voter-approved bonds to fill the void.

Supporters of the proposal said it would effectively create a state version of the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation, two of the nation’s largest institutional funders of scientific and public health research. The move follows California, Washington and Oregon’s announcement that they would form a [health alliance](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/us/rfk-jr-vaccines-western-health-alliance.html) to review scientific data and make vaccine recommendations for their residents, in an attempt to bypass vaccine skeptics in the Trump administration.

The plan to back scientific research calls for lawmakers to pass, and for voters to approve in a 2026 ballot measure, a proposed $23 billion in bonds, financing that will allow the state to make grants and loans to universities, research companies and health care organizations.

It would be the largest state effort of its kind, and is considerably more aggressive than one floated in Massachusetts in July, when Gov. Maura Healey [made a $400 million proposal for research](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/us/politics/massachusetts-healey-trump-funding.html) there.  
It would be the largest state effort of its kind, and is considerably more aggressive than one floated in Massachusetts in July, when Gov. Maura Healey [made a $400 million proposal for research](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/us/politics/massachusetts-healey-trump-funding.html) there.

In California, the federal cuts have been deep, and are expected to worsen. At one site alone — the University of California, Los Angeles — the Trump administration has already sought to freeze roughly $584 million in federal research grants, state lawmakers said.

The legislation behind the restoration effort — written by State Senator Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Assemblyman José Luis Solache Jr. of Lynwood, in Southern California — was made public late Friday, when the authors formally introduced it. [The bill](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB607) will not come up for consideration until January, after the state’s legislative recess, and will require the approval of a supermajority of the Legislature to be placed on the 2026 ballot.

There is no guarantee that it will pass the Legislature or the voters. The proposed bond amount is very large, [even by California’s vast standards](https://ballotpedia.org/List_of_statewide_bond_propositions_in_California). In 2020, voters rejected a $15 billion bond to support higher education. And last year, a $6.4 billion bond backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to fund treatment and housing for homeless people with severe mental illnesses and addiction barely passed.

However, the proposal’s backers, including the United Auto Workers, which represents tens of thousands of graduate students and other academic workers, are optimistic.

“It should be up to Californians, not Donald Trump, to decide whether or not we fund lifesaving research in cancer treatment, disease diagnostics, chronic diseases, climate science, wildfire preparedness and more,” Mike Miller, the director of U.A.W. Region 6, which represents some 76,000 academic workers in the state, said in a statement.

Democrats hold a legislative supermajority in Sacramento, and organized labor is both one of the state’s most potent lobbies and one of its most reliable sources of campaign volunteers. If the initiative makes it onto the ballot, it would require only a majority vote to pass. Democrats outnumber Republicans about two to one in the state’s electorate.

Californians have passed similar ballot measures before. In 2004, the state’s voters approved a ballot measure to support research on human embryonic stem cells after President George W. Bush’s administration restricted the use of public money for such research, citing opposition to the destruction of human embryos.

At the time, the $3 billion bond measure was the largest state-run scientific research effort in the country. In 2020, the state’s voters authorized another $5 billion in bonding to finance the research, along with potential treatments for brain and nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and dementia.

Now, scientific research has become a critical economic engine in the state, fueling jobs from the Silicon Valley’s tech giants to the vast farms of the Central Valley.

“As Trump and his cronies destroy federal science capacity and slash research funding for universities, California should double down on our global leadership on science,” Mr. Wiener said in an interview. “Scientific research is one of the pillars of the California economy.”

The proposal comes as the Trump administration and the University of California — the largest recipient of National Institutes of Health funding — have been locked in a standoff over the Los Angeles campus’s record on antisemitism and as the government conducts investigations into other campuses. The federal government has already demanded more than $1 billion from U.C.L.A. to resolve the dispute, more than it is known to have sought from any other university.

The U.C. president, James B. Milliken, warned last month that “a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”

N.I.H. funding is particularly essential to the U.C. system, which is among the largest employers in the state and includes six academic health centers. The system received more than $2.6 billion in a year from N.I.H., making it the biggest recipient in the country.

The university system has been in talks with the federal government, even as it has studied its legal options and sought to prepare legislators for a potentially costly response to the threats from Washington.

In a letter late last month, nearly three dozen legislators pleaded with Mr. Milliken and other university leaders “not to back down in the face of this political shakedown and to stand by Californians and their values.” The Legislature, the lawmakers added, “stands firmly behind you.”

In a response a few days later to Senator Wiener, who chairs the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, Mr. Milliken made clear just how much help he might ultimately need from Sacramento. If federal funding to the universities essentially vanished, Mr. Milliken wrote, U.C. “would need at least $4-5 billion per year to minimize the damage of that loss.”

However, the proposal’s backers, including the United Auto Workers, which represents tens of thousands of graduate students and other academic workers, are optimistic.

“It should be up to Californians, not Donald Trump, to decide whether or not we fund lifesaving research in cancer treatment, disease diagnostics, chronic diseases, climate science, wildfire preparedness and more,” Mike Miller, the director of U.A.W. Region 6, which represents some 76,000 academic workers in the state, said in a statement.

Democrats hold a legislative supermajority in Sacramento, and organized labor is both one of the state’s most potent lobbies and one of its most reliable sources of campaign volunteers. If the initiative makes it onto the ballot, it would require only a majority vote to pass. Democrats outnumber Republicans about two to one in the state’s electorate.

Californians have passed similar ballot measures before. In 2004, the state’s voters approved a ballot measure to support research on human embryonic stem cells after President George W. Bush’s administration restricted the use of public money for such research, citing opposition to the destruction of human embryos.

At the time, the $3 billion bond measure was the largest state-run scientific research effort in the country. In 2020, the state’s voters authorized another $5 billion in bonding to finance the research, along with potential treatments for brain and nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and dementia.

Now, scientific research has become a critical economic engine in the state, fueling jobs from the Silicon Valley’s tech giants to the vast farms of the Central Valley.

“As Trump and his cronies destroy federal science capacity and slash research funding for universities, California should double down on our global leadership on science,” Mr. Wiener said in an interview. “Scientific research is one of the pillars of the California economy.”

The proposal comes as the Trump administration and the University of California — the largest recipient of National Institutes of Health funding — have been locked in a standoff over the Los Angeles campus’s record on antisemitism and as the government conducts investigations into other campuses. The federal government has already demanded more than $1 billion from U.C.L.A. to resolve the dispute, more than it is known to have sought from any other university.

The U.C. president, James B. Milliken, warned last month that “a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”

N.I.H. funding is particularly essential to the U.C. system, which is among the largest employers in the state and includes six academic health centers. The system received more than $2.6 billion in a year from N.I.H., making it the biggest recipient in the country.

The university system has been in talks with the federal government, even as it has studied its legal options and sought to prepare legislators for a potentially costly response to the threats from Washington.

In a letter late last month, nearly three dozen legislators pleaded with Mr. Milliken and other university leaders “not to back down in the face of this political shakedown and to stand by Californians and their values.” The Legislature, the lawmakers added, “stands firmly behind you.”

In a response a few days later to Senator Wiener, who chairs the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, Mr. Milliken made clear just how much help he might ultimately need from Sacramento. If federal funding to the universities essentially vanished, Mr. Milliken wrote, U.C. “would need at least $4-5 billion per year to minimize the damage of that loss.”

Reddit,homelessness,Recommendations for temporary dog boarding (2-3 months) for those in crisis?,"Long story made somewhat short: because of personal issues, I’m trying to find long-term boarding (2-3 months) for my ESA (support dog), Brenda, who is a 50-pound brindle mix. My situation is a bit complex but is as follows:

I’m currently attending an IOP (intensive outpatient program) five days per week for mental health issues in nearby Artesia. My treatment is for depression and anxiety. I also have a very bad hip which I am scheduled to have replaced on September 16. Because of my physical and emotional issues (as well as financial issues due to my not being able to work currently), my ESA and I are staying temporarily with my elderly parents in Cerritos. However, the living situation is very difficult, partly due to my dog and my Mother’s dog having to be kept completely separate 24/7 —they despise one another and will attack whenever one encounters the other. And this situation makes for a difficult logistical issue, especially since I have to be gone each day for treatment. 

My parents are both older — 82 and 79, respectively, and I know that having my dog and I at their home is very disrupting to their living situation —mainly because of the dog issue and all of the stress that ensues from having to be so vigilant and aware of the dogs’ proximity to one another. 

I’ve been taking my dog each day to daycare at Petsmart in Cerritos in order to give all parties a break from the normal chaos, but this is a very short-term solution until I can find a better longer-term solution — one that will see me through until I have hip replacement surgery on September 16, at which point I will be much more functional and capable and therefore much more able to manage mine and my dog’s affairs. 

Also, I’m not looking for outright charity: I do have some money and can pay at least something for any care that my dog receives — and believe me, I feel embarrassed and ashamed for even being in this position to where I need to arrange temporary care for my dog. It’s very humbling having to reach out for help, and I know how involved pet care can be, since I worked as a pet sitter/dog walker from 2011-2021. 

I’m wondering if anyone knows of any groups or people or even boarding places that may offer temporary boarding (2-3months) for those in a bit of a crisis? Again, I’m expecting to pay for services rendered, but unfortunately, I can’t afford normal market-rate boarding fees for that length of time. 

I have reached out to various organizations (SPCA) and several other animal welfare groups, but most of those are geared towards helping those who are homeless or domestic violence survivors or military personnel. 

Just thought I would post this to see if anyone may have any suggestions or advice or may know of someone or someplace that I may contact who may be able to assist.

Thank you very much!

Reddit,homelessness,Long Beach Downtown Resident Cynde Soto Featured in CalMatters Article About How Cruel These Medicaid Cuts Are Gonna Be On The Elderly And Disabled,"This is a cut and paste from CalMatters. Cynde Soto goes to my church - First Congregational Church of Long Beach . I'm proud of her courage in putting herself out there to show, up close and personal, just how unjust this California State budget is.  

Cynde Soto, a quadriplegic who requires around-the-clock care, has been on Medi-Cal for most of her life. Recently, she came into a modest inheritance, about $8,000, that has helped cover her daily expenses. But it also means that she would lose her state health insurance under a proposal from Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Newsom has proposed restoring a $2,000 limit on an individual’s assets — including savings accounts and property other than a home and a car — and $3,000 for couples to qualify for Medi-Cal. Anyone 65 and older or disabled who exceeds that limit would be ineligible. Newsom also is proposing a cap on how much home care Medi-Cal enrollees like Soto could receive.

In unveiling the proposal, Newsom said that California has a “spending problem” and needs to make “difficult choices” to address the state’s $12 billion deficit, which he attributed in part to growing Medi-Cal costs. His proposal would save the state $94 million this budget year and more than $500 million the next year, according to the [governor’s budget document](https://ebudget.ca.gov/2025-26/pdf/Revised/BudgetSummary/HealthandHumanServices.pdf).

But health advocates say that it’s almost impossible for someone to live with just $2,000 in assets in California. Rent often exceeds that amount, and medical expenses not covered by insurance quickly add up.

Advocates say Newsom’s proposal unfairly targets people with disabilities and the elderly — those who are most likely to need full-time care and have fixed incomes.

“It’s draconian — $2,000 is no safety net for people,” said Kim Selfon, an attorney with Bet Tzedek, a legal services organization in Los Angeles.

For Soto, a Medi-Cal limit on assets would mean she would either lose the caretakers who help her bathe and eat or have to spend all of the money except for $2,000. With the inheritance, Soto said she can afford repairs to her Long Beach condo and buy medical supplies that Medi-Cal doesn’t cover, such as bandages or nutritional drinks to supplement her diet.

“It’s not cheap being disabled,” Soto said. “I’m really scared. I cannot live without my help.”

**When asset limits were lifted, Medi-Cal enrollment surged**

Some lawmakers and disability advocates have argued against the asset limit for years. They say it forces people into poverty and hasn’t kept up with rising inflation and cost of living. 

Newsom agreed to raise the limit to $130,000 per person in 2022. Then in 2024, the [limit was erased completely](https://calmatters.org/health/2021/06/medical-expansion-legislature/). Now Newsom wants to bring back the original limit of $2,000, an amount that was set in 1989. 

This would reinstate complex rules about wealth and property that kept thousands of seniors and disabled people from qualifying for Medi-Cal. Under those rules, an individual’s first home and car are exempt, but [other properties count toward the $2,000 limit](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/formsandpubs/Documents/Legislative%20Reports/Medi-Cal-Asset-Limits-Supplemental-Report.pdf). The balance of a 401k or retirement account are exempt, although payouts are considered income. Life insurance, cash on hand and savings accounts also count towards the limit. Even certain types of funeral plots count. 

The test would apply only to people 65 and older as well as those with disabilities, which creates a financial cliff for those about to turn 65. Medicare, which many seniors use for health insurance, does not cover long-term care and requires some co-pays, so many people use Medi-Cal to supplement their Medicare benefits.

In a recent [Assembly hearing](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/hearings/259234?t=224&f=1d32cdca90d039d744533afdd8bb85d1), Newsom administration officials said when the limit was eliminated, far more people enrolled in Medi-Cal than anticipated, contributing to the state’s growing costs. Between 112,000 to 115,000 people enrolled compared to early estimates of just 40,000, said health care services director Michelle Baass.

Seniors make up a small portion of all Medi-Cal enrollees, but they’re about twice as expensive as the average enrollee because they use more medical care. [The elimination of the asset test](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/5010) last year contributed to most of the senior enrollment growth and cost the state about $500 million more than expected, according to a report by the nonpartisan [Legislative Analyst’s Office. ](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/5010)

Still, lawmakers during the hearing questioned the prudence of kicking seniors and people with disabilities off of the program and whether it would actually save money in the long run. 

Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo, a Democrat from Santa Clarita, said these groups would need more expensive care like nursing home stays or homeless services if the asset test were reinstated.

“This is going to lead to more homelessness of seniors and the disabled. That’s what’s going to happen, and that will cost our state money too,” Schiavo said.

# Making it ‘more expensive to age in California‘

Al Sanderson, one of Selfon’s clients, says that’s exactly what would happen to him. The Redondo Beach resident broke his neck three years ago in a surfing accident that left him paralyzed.  

Sanderson said his monthly rent costs more than the asset limit. He has significant savings as a former high school physical education teacher and baseball coach that he uses to pay for utilities, transportation and things that his kids need now that he no longer works. 

If he got kicked off of Medi-Cal and lost his caretakers, Sanderson said he would lose his independence.

“How am I going to pay people to come help me? How am I supposed to survive and live? I’d have to go to a nursing home,” Sanderson said.

Without full-time home care, both Sanderson and Soto would most likely end up in nursing homes, a more expensive option that is covered by Medi-Cal. The state pays on average more than $114,000 per person each year for nursing home care, according to Justice in Aging, which pushed for the elimination of the asset test. In contrast, the average annual cost of in-home care is less than a quarter of that, $25,400 a year.

>AL SANDERSON, REDONDO BEACH RESIDENT

Kevin Prindiville, executive director of Justice in Aging, said Newsom’s proposal would “make it more expensive to age in California.”

California’s elimination of the asset test came under fire this month from [congressional Republicans, who claimed that it allows the “wealthiest Californians”](https://x.com/chiproytx/status/1918039017955926054/photo/2) to get free health care. But lawyers with legal aid organizations that help people enroll in Medi-Cal say that’s not happening. 

Regardless of their assets, Medi-Cal enrollees still need to meet income limits, which are currently 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $1,800 per month, said Linda Nguy, a lobbyist with the Western Center on Law and Poverty. 

“Our clients are not millionaires,” Nguy said. “We’re talking about people with very low incomes who aren’t able to access the health care services that they need.”

Ronald Dallatorre, 58, enrolled in Medi-Cal just two months ago. He had been looking forward to getting caretakers to help him at his Compton home so that his wife could take a break. 

Dallatorre got sick with COVID-19 in April 2020. He spent four weeks on a ventilator and almost a year in a hospital. Now the former heavy duty mechanic has [Guillan-Barré](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793) syndrome, an autoimmune disease that attacks the nervous system, causing muscle weakness and numbness.

Dallatorre uses a wheelchair and can’t move his hands. His wife quit her job with L.A. Unified School District to take care of him full-time. The Dallatorres also own a second home that a close family friend lives in, rent-free. Under the proposed budget, Dallatorre would be ineligible for Medi-Cal because of this property.

>LINDA NGUY, WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY

If he is kicked off Medi-Cal because of the asset test, Dallatorre said his medical costs would still be covered through his wife’s insurance, but they can’t afford caretakers. His wife would have to continue as his full-time support.

“I worked 40 years of my life never receiving help, always paying taxes. I was glad to do it because I thought maybe when I need it, somebody will be able to help me,” Dallatorre said. “I didn’t know how stupid the system is.”

The test would apply only to people 65 and older as well as those with disabilities, which creates a financial cliff for those about to turn 65. Medicare, which many seniors use for health insurance, does not cover long-term care and requires some co-pays, so many people use Medi-Cal to supplement their Medicare benefits.

In a recent [Assembly hearing](https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/hearings/259234?t=224&f=1d32cdca90d039d744533afdd8bb85d1), Newsom administration officials said when the limit was eliminated, far more people enrolled in Medi-Cal than anticipated, contributing to the state’s growing costs. Between 112,000 to 115,000 people enrolled compared to early estimates of just 40,000, said health care services director Michelle Baass.

Seniors make up a small portion of all Medi-Cal enrollees, but they’re about twice as expensive as the average enrollee because they use more medical care. [The elimination of the asset test](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/5010) last year contributed to most of the senior enrollment growth and cost the state about $500 million more than expected, according to a report by the nonpartisan [Legislative Analyst’s Office. ](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/5010)

Still, lawmakers during the hearing questioned the prudence of kicking seniors and people with disabilities off of the program and whether it would actually save money in the long run. 

Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo, a Democrat from Santa Clarita, said these groups would need more expensive care like nursing home stays or homeless services if the asset test were reinstated.

“This is going to lead to more homelessness of seniors and the disabled. That’s what’s going to happen, and that will cost our state money too,” Schiavo said.

# Making it ‘more expensive to age in California‘

Al Sanderson, one of Selfon’s clients, says that’s exactly what would happen to him. The Redondo Beach resident broke his neck three years ago in a surfing accident that left him paralyzed.  

Sanderson said his monthly rent costs more than the asset limit. He has significant savings as a former high school physical education teacher and baseball coach that he uses to pay for utilities, transportation and things that his kids need now that he no longer works. 

If he got kicked off of Medi-Cal and lost his caretakers, Sanderson said he would lose his independence.

“How am I going to pay people to come help me? How am I supposed to survive and live? I’d have to go to a nursing home,” Sanderson said.

Without full-time home care, both Sanderson and Soto would most likely end up in nursing homes, a more expensive option that is covered by Medi-Cal. The state pays on average more than $114,000 per person each year for nursing home care, according to Justice in Aging, which pushed for the elimination of the asset test. In contrast, the average annual cost of in-home care is less than a quarter of that, $25,400 a year.

>AL SANDERSON, REDONDO BEACH RESIDENT

Kevin Prindiville, executive director of Justice in Aging, said Newsom’s proposal would “make it more expensive to age in California.”

California’s elimination of the asset test came under fire this month from [congressional Republicans, who claimed that it allows the “wealthiest Californians”](https://x.com/chiproytx/status/1918039017955926054/photo/2) to get free health care. But lawyers with legal aid organizations that help people enroll in Medi-Cal say that’s not happening. 

Regardless of their assets, Medi-Cal enrollees still need to meet income limits, which are currently 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $1,800 per month, said Linda Nguy, a lobbyist with the Western Center on Law and Poverty. 

“Our clients are not millionaires,” Nguy said. “We’re talking about people with very low incomes who aren’t able to access the health care services that they need.”

Ronald Dallatorre, 58, enrolled in Medi-Cal just two months ago. He had been looking forward to getting caretakers to help him at his Compton home so that his wife could take a break. 

Dallatorre got sick with COVID-19 in April 2020. He spent four weeks on a ventilator and almost a year in a hospital. Now the former heavy duty mechanic has [Guillan-Barré](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793) syndrome, an autoimmune disease that attacks the nervous system, causing muscle weakness and numbness.

Dallatorre uses a wheelchair and can’t move his hands. His wife quit her job with L.A. Unified School District to take care of him full-time. The Dallatorres also own a second home that a close family friend lives in, rent-free. Under the proposed budget, Dallatorre would be ineligible for Medi-Cal because of this property.

>LINDA NGUY, WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY

If he is kicked off Medi-Cal because of the asset test, Dallatorre said his medical costs would still be covered through his wife’s insurance, but they can’t afford caretakers. His wife would have to continue as his full-time support.

“I worked 40 years of my life never receiving help, always paying taxes. I was glad to do it because I thought maybe when I need it, somebody will be able to help me,” Dallatorre said. “I didn’t know how stupid the system is.”

Police identified the minors as the suspects in multiple burglaries, including at Sweet Jill's Bakery on Second Street back in April.

LONG BEACH, CA — Two boys have been arrested in connection with a series of burglaries and vandalism incidents in Long Beach in April, police said Friday.


LONG BEACH, CA — Two boys have been arrested in connection with a series of burglaries and vandalism incidents in Long Beach in April, police said Friday.


The boys, ages 12 and 13, are suspected of shattering the doors or windows of six businesses from April 6 to 26 and stealing from at least three of those businesses, according to the Long Beach Police Department.

""These arrests should serve as a reminder that if you choose to engage in criminal activity in our city, you will be held accountable,"" LBPD Chief Wally Hebeish said in a press release Friday. ""We remain committed to protecting our entire community and addressing unlawful behavior appropriately.”

Police say the boys, along with about four other minors, burglarized a Pizza Hut, a store at 2nd and PCH and Sweet Jill's Bakery in Belmont Shore. On at least two occasions, the suspects used a stolen vehicle to move around, police said.

Last month, Sweet Jill's Bakery called on the public to help identify the people who broke into the business.

The owner posted security footage on social media showing several people getting out of an SUV and throwing items against their glass door and breaking it. Once broken, the suspects can be seen going inside.

The suspects in this case caused damage to the store's registers and stole baked goods, police said.

Burglary detectives eventually identified at least two of the suspects through their investigation, which included canvassing the crime scenes, speaking with business owners and reviewing security footage, according to the LBPD.

Detectives served warrants at both the boy's homes in Long Beach, according to police. The 13-year-old was arrested at his home on suspicion of commercial burglary, possession of a stolen vehicle and felony vandalism, police said.


The 12-year-old was not home when police arrived, but later turned himself in at the LBPD's Downtown Long Beach station, police said, adding that he was booked on suspicion of commercial burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle.

Both boys were then released because of their ages, police said. Their cases will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, which will weigh what charges to file, if any, against the boys.

# What is the Long Beach Justice Fund?

The Long Beach Justice Fund is a legal defense fund and program that provides legal help for low income immigrants at risk of deportation that live or work in Long Beach.

# Why do we need the Long Beach Justice Fund?

In the last three months, fewer than one in five immigrants in Long Beach had a lawyer to help fight their cases.  While many people in the deportation process have valid legal reasons to stay in the United States, they cannot argue their cases well enough without legal help. Legal representation allows people to make the best decision about how to best fight their cases and receive the rights available to them under the U.S. law.

# Who will be providing the services?

[Immigrant Defenders Law Center](https://www.immdef.org/) (ImmDef) is the legal service provider for the Long Beach Justice Fund. As one of the largest nonprofit providers of deportation defense in California, ImmDef is focused on helping immigrants who are in some of the most legally complicated situations. This includes representation for unaccompanied children and youth who arrived alone to the U.S. and now face deportation, adults with mental health challenges, and legal permanent residents facing deportation due to unlawful conviction.

# Who is funding the Long Beach Justice Fund?

The City of Long Beach gave $250,000 toward the fund and Vera Institute of Justice gave $100,000, for a total of $350,000. Charitable donations will help serve more people and keep the fund alive after the initial two years.

# Who chose the Legal Service Provider?

The request for proposal (RFP) review committee had representatives from the city of Long Beach, Vera Institute of Justice, Human Relations Commission and the Sanctuary Long Beach Coalition.  The committee worked to determine the specific requirements and timeline for the RFP process and chose a legal service provider(s) based on those requirements.

# What services will they provide?

The fund will give free legal representation to low income immigrants living or working in Long Beach, who are at risk of deportation. The Immigrant Defenders Law Center will be working with detention centers to find people from Long Beach in need of legal help. They will also be accepting referrals of non-detained people from local community organizations.

# When will services begin?

Legal services begin in June 2019.

# Who qualifies?

Requirements for the Long Beach Justice Fund include:

1.     Person must live or work in Long Beach.  
2.     Household income below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.  
3.     Detained and non-detained people at risk of deportation.

Reddit,crime,City to honor the Lost 74,"The sea was glass that night, illuminated under bright moonlight, sailors recalled. It was late spring of 1969 and the American destroyer USS Frank E. Evans, which had been bombarding the coast of South Vietnam just a couple weeks earlier, was steaming in close formation with three other vessels, including the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, as part of multinational training exercises in the South China Sea.

The exercises were going well, until the early morning hours of June 3, when the Melbourne collided with the Evans. The hulking Australian ship knifed into the Evans just aft of the ship’s forward smokestack, quickly slicing the much smaller ship in two.

In all, 74 of the 336 American sailors aboard the Evans died that night. All but one of them were trapped in the ship’s forward section. Now detached from the rest of the ship, it rolled over and sank in 6,600 feet of water just nine minutes after the collision, according to the Navy.

Seventy-three bodies were never recovered. 

Next month, on the 56th anniversary of the tragic collision, the city will honor those lost on the Evans in a ceremony at the Shoreline Aquatic Park Navy Memorial.

For all those complaining about privacy I completely see their point. Comparisons to the CCP's surveillance state are apt. I spent quite a bit of time in Lakewood and the need for these cameras there is lost on me.

But here in LONG BEACH I could see three very specific uses.

Illegal fireworks keeping people up and scaring the hell out of pets between the months of June and September are ridiculous. And the problems with getting the authorities to actually do anything about it are numerous. 


The way so many cars speed around residential streets that have kids, old people and the disabled around Long Beach is ridiculous. I have seen this speeding by entitled teen drivers in high income Belmont Shore and by grown ass men in low income West Side.  

Graffiti taggers. Need I say more?

Reddit,safety,"No stereo, no paint, no tech: Jeff Bezos-backed EV truck unveiled in Long Beach","On Thursday, the secretive startup vehicle manufacturer Slate Auto unveiled its electric vehicle: the Slate Truck.

In an effort to cut costs, the company has stripped the truck down to the barest of bones — manual window cranks, no paint job, no extended cabs, no long truck bed and, of course, no stereo or touchscreen.

While no bells or whistles come standard, the company’s pickup has a host of add-ons available for unspecified additional costs.

While there is practically no tech included, the truck features a universal phone mount and USB power, allowing the driver’s phone to serve as the technological interface. Slate suggests bringing a bluetooth speaker along for the ride, which would allow drivers to listen to music or other entertainment via their phone.

If you would rather a more traditional listening experience, speakers can be added into the truck for an additional cost. Other add-ons include power windows, a center console, a tablet mount, auxiliary buttons, roof rack, upgraded bumpers, a spare tire carrier, running boards, wraps and decals, among others — about 100 options in all.

The company also will offer a kit to convert the two-seater truck into a five-seat SUV.

Slate boasts that the base model truck will be “radically affordable,” with a price tag “expected” to be under $20,000 after federal rebates reserved for people who drive electric vehicles — programs the Trump administration already has in its crosshairs. This puts the base price of the truck around at least $27,500, which is “subject to change,” despite its anemic design.

By comparison, the 2025 double-cab Ford Maverick XL, with its hybrid engine and all its modern vehicle amenities, has a starting price of $27,000.

Internet reactions were mixed, with some poking fun at the concept itself, including one user who called it a “billionaire funded Temu truck.”

“I’ve seen golf carts with more features,” wrote @lbprotest on Instagram.

But others were infatuated with the minimalist concept and ability to customize the vehicle.

“I love the fact that they're showing off how customizable the vehicle can be,” wrote another. “Somehow this concept isn't more widely appreciated.”

Reddit,safety,"My First Apartment Experience in Long Beach, CA (Bay Hill Apartments / Equity Residential)","Hi all, new to Long Beach! Sharing this for the people like me who use reddit for reviews. I guess this is a rant?

Edit: The location is near the traffic circle, between Termino and Redondo.

Preface:I don’t normally post to Reddit and tend to delete accounts often. I’ve had too many experiences where people online invalidate personal stories, and frankly, sharing intimate details comes with safety concerns. But to challenge my social anxiety and contribute meaningfully to others in transition, I’ve decided to start putting my experiences out there. If you’re a new transplant to Long Beach, especially coming from the East Coast like I did (Baltimore/DC Metropolitan area), I hope this post helps you make informed decisions.

TLDR – Bay Hill Apartments (Long Beach, CA) Review

I relocated from the Baltimore/DC area to Long Beach in July 2024 and signed a lease at Bay Hill, managed by Equity Residential. While the apartment looked promising online—great views, in-unit laundry, pet-friendly—the reality was more complicated. The unit wasn’t move-in ready (unclean, maintenance issues, lingering odors), and the rent ended up being higher than expected due to added utility fees and other costs.

Shared spaces weren’t well maintained, and communication with the on-site staff—though polite—was limited by corporate policies. A payment processing delay led to a Pay or Vacate notice despite prior communication, and my lease renewal came with little notice and a steep increase in rent. Even after professionally/deep cleaning the unit upon move-out, part of my deposit was withheld.

Final Take:

While Bay Hill has potential and a convenient location, my experience ultimately felt impersonal and overly transactional. The view and amenities didn’t outweigh the lack of transparency, hidden fees, and corporate-style management. If you're moving to Long Beach, I recommend holding out for a privately managed rental—there are options that offer more care, clarity, and respect for your living experience.

**My scoring:**  
Cleanliness Upon Move-In: 2/5  
Staff Helpfulness: 2/5  
Amenities/Shared Spaces: 0/5  
View: 4/5Neighborhood  
Walkability: 0/5  
Access to Stores/Etc.: 4/5  
Policies & Transparency: 0/5  
Overall: Would not recommend (Let me know if you have questions about specific things and I can give a rating)

The Apartment: Bay Hill (Managed by Equity Residential)

Bay Hill is part of Equity Residential, one of the largest landlords in the U.S.. I rented a 2BR/2BA unit at $3,194/month + pet rent. It offered parking, in-unit laundry, and a great view—things that checked key boxes for me. The website looked polished and reviews were great. I thought I’d found a home for at least the next 2-3 years.

In hindsight, I should have looked beyond Google reviews and deeper into Equity Residential as a business.

Moving in--

I moved in July 2024 after a long cross-country drive with family and my pet. Hours before arriving, I got a call saying the apartment wouldn’t be ready. This was a red flag, especially after we had to re-sign our lease due to a clerical error—technically, we weren’t even obligated to continue. But with my exhausted family at the front of my mind, I pushed for them to get the unit ready, and they eventually did… or to whatever standard of *ready* they follow.

We were given verbal confirmation that the carpet was new. Spoiler: I don’t think it was. The unit was filthy. There were stains on the ceilings and walls, burn marks in the kitchen, a broken fridge gasket, stagnant water in the dishwasher, peeling vinyl cabinets, and a tub that needed serious reglazing. The oven was disgusting. On top of that, there were small flies—especially in the second bathroom—and a persistent wet dog smell. I suspect the ""new carpet"" was the source.

I spent weeks deep cleaning and coordinating maintenance. As renters, we expect some imperfections, and I grew up in a literal housing project—but this went well beyond normal wear. I had to work hard just to feel comfortable or make it livable.

Hidden Fees--

The advertised rent wasn’t what I ended up paying. Because I asked them to hold the unit during my move, the rent increased to around $3,300. Then came the hidden fees: utilities like water, trash, and sewer were billed via a third party (not included in rent), pushing my monthly total to over $3,500. I expected maybe $50 extra, not $200+. These fees added up fast and felt incredibly deceptive. This is well documented as an issue across other the properties.

Shared Spaces and Pet Areas--

The shared spaces were... disgusting. Hallways reeked of urine and were stained with dog feces and likely spilled trash. Pet owners didn’t clean up after their dogs, and there were no grassy areas—just piles of waste along the mulch. Even after power washing, the smell persisted.

Staff & Maintenance--

Equity’s operational structure removes a lot of power from on-site staff. The leasing team wasn’t necessarily rude, just unhelpful—because their hands were tied.

One example: Equity switched to a new payment platform (Bilt), which I didn’t want to use without vetting it. I opted to send rent from my bank directly. Due to a banking delay and the first of the month being towards the end of the week, my payment landed on a weekend. I notified the leasing agent, sent a screenshot, and was told it would be fine. Days later? I received a Pay or Vacate notice on my door. Equity rejected the payment because it hadn’t cleared by the due date and they could not tell how much it was. I had to pay another $3.5K out of pocket while the original payment was pending. The staff never warned me of this policy, and only a collections rep explained it after the fact. In short, Equity’s system punished me for a banking delay they were fully aware of—and their staff never advocated, warned me, or informed me of alternatives (say a cashiers check). Side note: This Pay or Vacate nonsense is abhorrent and Equity rejecting a payment so they can proceed with eviction asap? \*Side eye\*

Renewal Shuffle--

I received my lease renewal 45 days before move-out, giving me just two weeks to find a new place or agree to a $3,500+ base rent (likely $3,800+ monthly with fees added in). We tried to negotiate but were told *the system deemed us not worth retaining at the original price*. They also withheld part of my deposit despite the apartment being professionally/deep cleaned. That story alone can be added to the comments if anyone wants to talk about it.

Final Thoughts

Despite all this, Long Beach is now my home. I didn’t expect things to be like Baltimore/DC, and I’m not against adapting—but I do expect a basic standard of living, especially at this price point. Bay Hill is located next to a 6-lane highway. There are no proper crosswalks or easy walking routes. Walkability is zero, or at least zero when you consider how unsafe it is to walk/run along a tiny slither of concrete while cars gun it up a hill. While the property houses a diverse range of people (military, professionals, students) and is conveniently located near the airport and shops, the poor management, hidden costs, and lack of care outweigh the convenience.

I’ve since moved to another Long Beach neighborhood and am renting from a private landlord. It’s not perfect, but it’s night-and-day better. More walkable, more community, and more humanity in how I’m treated.

If You’re Moving to Long Beach...

Sharing this for the people like me who use reddit for reviews. I guess this is a rant?

Edit: The location is near the traffic circle, between Termino and Redondo.

Preface:I don’t normally post to Reddit and tend to delete accounts often. I’ve had too many experiences where people online invalidate personal stories, and frankly, sharing intimate details comes with safety concerns. But to challenge my social anxiety and contribute meaningfully to others in transition, I’ve decided to start putting my experiences out there. If you’re a new transplant to Long Beach, especially coming from the East Coast like I did (Baltimore/DC Metropolitan area), I hope this post helps you make informed decisions.

TLDR – Bay Hill Apartments (Long Beach, CA) Review

I relocated from the Baltimore/DC area to Long Beach in July 2024 and signed a lease at Bay Hill, managed by Equity Residential. While the apartment looked promising online—great views, in-unit laundry, pet-friendly—the reality was more complicated. The unit wasn’t move-in ready (unclean, maintenance issues, lingering odors), and the rent ended up being higher than expected due to added utility fees and other costs.

Shared spaces weren’t well maintained, and communication with the on-site staff—though polite—was limited by corporate policies. A payment processing delay led to a Pay or Vacate notice despite prior communication, and my lease renewal came with little notice and a steep increase in rent. Even after professionally/deep cleaning the unit upon move-out, part of my deposit was withheld.

Final Take:

While Bay Hill has potential and a convenient location, my experience ultimately felt impersonal and overly transactional. The view and amenities didn’t outweigh the lack of transparency, hidden fees, and corporate-style management. If you're moving to Long Beach, I recommend holding out for a privately managed rental—there are options that offer more care, clarity, and respect for your living experience.

**My scoring:**  
Cleanliness Upon Move-In: 2/5  
Staff Helpfulness: 2/5  
Amenities/Shared Spaces: 0/5  
View: 4/5Neighborhood  
Walkability: 0/5  
Access to Stores/Etc.: 4/5  
Policies & Transparency: 0/5  
Overall: Would not recommend (Let me know if you have questions about specific things and I can give a rating)

The Apartment: Bay Hill (Managed by Equity Residential)

Bay Hill is part of Equity Residential, one of the largest landlords in the U.S.. I rented a 2BR/2BA unit at $3,194/month + pet rent. It offered parking, in-unit laundry, and a great view—things that checked key boxes for me. The website looked polished and reviews were great. I thought I’d found a home for at least the next 2-3 years.

In hindsight, I should have looked beyond Google reviews and deeper into Equity Residential as a business.

Moving in--

I moved in July 2024 after a long cross-country drive with family and my pet. Hours before arriving, I got a call saying the apartment wouldn’t be ready. This was a red flag, especially after we had to re-sign our lease due to a clerical error—technically, we weren’t even obligated to continue. But with my exhausted family at the front of my mind, I pushed for them to get the unit ready, and they eventually did… or to whatever standard of *ready* they follow.

We were given verbal confirmation that the carpet was new. Spoiler: I don’t think it was. The unit was filthy. There were stains on the ceilings and walls, burn marks in the kitchen, a broken fridge gasket, stagnant water in the dishwasher, peeling vinyl cabinets, and a tub that needed serious reglazing. The oven was disgusting. On top of that, there were small flies—especially in the second bathroom—and a persistent wet dog smell. I suspect the ""new carpet"" was the source.

I spent weeks deep cleaning and coordinating maintenance. As renters, we expect some imperfections, and I grew up in a literal housing project—but this went well beyond normal wear. I had to work hard just to feel comfortable or make it livable.

Hidden Fees--

The advertised rent wasn’t what I ended up paying. Because I asked them to hold the unit during my move, the rent increased to around $3,300. Then came the hidden fees: utilities like water, trash, and sewer were billed via a third party (not included in rent), pushing my monthly total to over $3,500. I expected maybe $50 extra, not $200+. These fees added up fast and felt incredibly deceptive. This is well documented as an issue across other the properties.

Shared Spaces and Pet Areas--

The shared spaces were... disgusting. Hallways reeked of urine and were stained with dog feces and likely spilled trash. Pet owners didn’t clean up after their dogs, and there were no grassy areas—just piles of waste along the mulch. Even after power washing, the smell persisted.

Staff & Maintenance--

Equity’s operational structure removes a lot of power from on-site staff. The leasing team wasn’t necessarily rude, just unhelpful—because their hands were tied.

One example: Equity switched to a new payment platform (Bilt), which I didn’t want to use without vetting it. I opted to send rent from my bank directly. Due to a banking delay and the first of the month being towards the end of the week, my payment landed on a weekend. I notified the leasing agent, sent a screenshot, and was told it would be fine. Days later? I received a Pay or Vacate notice on my door. Equity rejected the payment because it hadn’t cleared by the due date and they could not tell how much it was. I had to pay another $3.5K out of pocket while the original payment was pending. The staff never warned me of this policy, and only a collections rep explained it after the fact. In short, Equity’s system punished me for a banking delay they were fully aware of—and their staff never advocated, warned me, or informed me of alternatives (say a cashiers check). Side note: This Pay or Vacate nonsense is abhorrent and Equity rejecting a payment so they can proceed with eviction asap? \*Side eye\*

Renewal Shuffle--

I received my lease renewal 45 days before move-out, giving me just two weeks to find a new place or agree to a $3,500+ base rent (likely $3,800+ monthly with fees added in). We tried to negotiate but were told *the system deemed us not worth retaining at the original price*. They also withheld part of my deposit despite the apartment being professionally/deep cleaned. That story alone can be added to the comments if anyone wants to talk about it.

Final Thoughts

Despite all this, Long Beach is now my home. I didn’t expect things to be like Baltimore/DC, and I’m not against adapting—but I do expect a basic standard of living, especially at this price point. Bay Hill is located next to a 6-lane highway. There are no proper crosswalks or easy walking routes. Walkability is zero, or at least zero when you consider how unsafe it is to walk/run along a tiny slither of concrete while cars gun it up a hill. While the property houses a diverse range of people (military, professionals, students) and is conveniently located near the airport and shops, the poor management, hidden costs, and lack of care outweigh the convenience.

I’ve since moved to another Long Beach neighborhood and am renting from a private landlord. It’s not perfect, but it’s night-and-day better. More walkable, more community, and more humanity in how I’m treated.

If You’re Moving to Long Beach...

Please be wary of large corporate landlords like Equity Residential. They’re not designed with people in mind—they’re designed to protect the bottom line. Don’t fall for the glowing reviews (many are collected during tours). Look for message boards, ask around, and if possible, hold out for a private landlord. You are not an investment, you are a human, and you deserve to be treated as such

Reddit,safety,Hey Long Beach! Future resident here looking for apartment advice!,"Hi everyone,

My husband and I will be moving to Long Beach next year as an expat for work, and I’d be so grateful for any local advice or insight you can share.  

I’m hoping to find a place that feels comfortable, as safe as possible, and convenient. Ideally, I’d love somewhere with walkable access to daily amenities and a well-managed community.  


**Apartments I’m currently considering (all near Downtown LB):**

1. Onni East Village (333 E Broadway)

2. Aster (250 E Broadway)

3. IMT Gallery 421 (421 W Broadway)

 4. AMLI Park Broadway (245 W Broadway)

5. The Crest (207 E Seaside Way)

6. Pine at 6th (555 Pine Ave)

7. RESA (400 W Ocean Blvd)

 



**A little more about me and what I’m looking for:**

1. Budget: up to $3,000 per month

2. Unit type: 1 bedroom

3. Work: My office is near Downtown Long Beach. I’m planning to commute by bike most of the time and only use a car when I need to go to the airport or travel farther away.

4. Groceries: I really value being able to walk to grocery stores or markets

5. Lifestyle: I love Pilates and yoga, so it would be wonderful to be near a good studio or fitness center

6. Safety: I’ve heard different opinions about Downtown Long Beach. While I understand the concerns, I also don’t feel completely at ease in areas like Bixby Knolls, Belmont Shore, or Belmont Heights. The houses there tend to be lower and more open, which feels a bit less secure to me.  I’d feel more comfortable in a modern apartment building with good security and a friendly sense of community.



If anyone has personal experiences or thoughts about these buildings or neighborhoods, I’d really appreciate hearing your perspective.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and share your thoughts.

No headlights, no turn signals, and sometimes even the brakes look questionable.

Early in the planning process for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Los Angeles, the city of Santa Monica was tapped to host the beach volleyball event — a no-brainer considering the sport as we know it today was created on those same sands over a century ago.

Those preliminary talks began with LA’s first bid for the Games back in 2016. Actual negotiations began in 2023 and came to an end in early April after Santa Monica and LA28 (the local organizing committee for the Games) failed to “agree to terms around community benefits, operational details and financial guarantees,” according to the city.

Among Santa Monica’s concerns were the projected financial impacts should it host the event. According to an economic impact reportcommissioned by the city council from HR&A Advisors, the city stood to lose an estimated $12.1 million if it hosted beach volleyball. In the report, HR&A projected a net loss of $1.45 million if Santa Monica were to host the event, compared to a net gain of $10.65 million should it not.

The report stated the city would still see increased visitation due to the Olympics being in the region without incurring the operational costs.

Less than two weeks after negotiations between Santa Monica and LA28 fell apart, it was announced Long Beach would host beach volleyball at Alamitos Beach.

The city of Long Beach, however, which is slated to host more events (18) outside of LA proper than any other city, has not conducted an independent economic impact report, which would look at estimated costs such as public safety and refuse collection as well as revenue generation.

Instead, the city is awaiting an economic impact report from LA28, which is expected to be released “in the coming months,” LA28 officials said in an email last week. The report will include projections related to Long Beach, according to officials, but it’s unclear how detailed individual city impacts will be reported.

“Given that the 2028 Games are a regional effort involving multiple host and venue cities, the City’s approach has been to first review the broader analysis already underway before determining whether any additional evaluation specific to Long Beach would be necessary,” city spokesperson Kevin Lee said in a July 3 email.

In the 129 years since the modern Olympics began, only two cities have turned a profit as host: Paris last year, which netted just shy of €27 million, per Visionary Marketing; and LA in 1984, when it finished with a $215 million operating surplus, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

“Los Angeles was the only city to bid for the 1984 Summer Olympics, allowing it to negotiate exceptionally favorable terms with the IOC,” the CFR wrote last year, also noting that LA utilized existing venues, not unlike its 2028 plan. “A growing number of economists argue that the benefits of hosting the games are at best exaggerated and at worst nonexistent, leaving many host countries with large debts and maintenance liabilities.”

But Long Beach officials remain confident that the Games won’t put the city in the hole.

“The intent certainly is to go into it … for the full cost offset,” City Manager Tom Modica said in a May interview with the Watchdog. Santa Monica, he noted, is a small city and the volleyball event would have disrupted its greatest revenue generator: the beach and pier.

But money isn’t everything when it comes to hosting the Games, according to Modica, as is the case with the Grand Prix race weekend.

“A big part of it is being seen all over the world,” he said. “The Olympics has that potential at a much higher magnitude. This is our moment to really show the world what Long Beach is all about.”

The Olympics coming to town has already had an impact on the city, Modica said, with individuals and businesses looking to move to Long Beach. The Games are a moment for the city to shed the “best kept secret” descriptor, he added.

According to the CFR, however, impact studies conducted by cities prior to the Games often argue that hosting the event will result in a “major economic lift” through job creation, tourism and increased economic output.

“However, research carried out after the games shows that these purported benefits are dubious,” the CFR said. “Ultimately, there is little evidence for an overall positive economic impact.”

The CFR commentary is based on normal circumstances for host nations. The 2028 Games, however, have a variable that no prior Olympics has: President Donald Trump.

The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, which has seen even legal residents and American citizens hauled off by masked agents in unmarked cars, as well as recent travel bans could have an adverse effect on the Games. As LA Times Business Columnist Michael Hiltzik notes, all 12 countries on Trump’s travel ban list, as well as 36 others that could be added, sent athletes to the 2024 Paris Games — not to mention officials and fans.

While the policy does make an exception for athletes, coaches and immediate relatives, it mentions no such exception for fans, according to the Associated Press. LA28 Chair Casey Wasserman, however, is on record saying the White House understands the need to be “accommodating” when it comes to visas for those coming to the Games. But concerns persist, Hiltzik writes.

“Are those assurances reliable? Trump’s policymaking record is inauspicious,” Hiltzik said. “Whether the product of deliberate policymaking or whim, Trump’s capacity for sabotaging the … Olympics is vast.”

Reddit,safety,How can I help a mentally ill relative who is keeping two large dogs in unsafe conditions?,"Hi all,
I’m trying to get advice without causing harm or escalating anything too fast.

My uncle lives with mental illness (paranoia, likely undiagnosed or untreated) and also drinks. He owns two large, powerful dogs — a pit bull and a Belgian Malinois — who are kept in crates most of the time. Due to his disability, he’s not able to walk or exercise them the way they need.

One of the dogs barks constantly, and he recently began muzzling it to stop the noise. He truly believes he’s taking care of them, but the reality is the dogs are suffering — mentally and physically. They are restless, frustrated, and not getting the stimulation or release they need.

There are also young kids and an elder in the home, and I’m concerned for everyone’s safety — including the dogs, who may become reactive from being caged and overstimulated.

I don’t want to call animal control right away or get the dogs taken from him — I know that would destroy him emotionally. I just want to find a way to:
	•	Help him see the situation for what it is
	•	Explore safe rehoming or support options
	•	Or connect him with dog-walking services or programs that can help handle large dogs

Has anyone had experience with situations like this? Are there community programs, especially for disabled or low-income dog owners, that could help? And what’s the safest way to bring this up to someone who might feel attacked?

Thanks for reading. This is a heavy one for me.",15,15,2025-06-04 01:04:38,https://reddit.com/r/longbeach/comments/1l2sq1b/how_can_i_help_a_mentally_ill_relative_who_is/,"How can I help a mentally ill relative who is keeping two large dogs in unsafe conditions? Hi all,

Reddit,safety,Demolition of dilapidated village near Queen Mary has begun,"Demolition of Londontown, the defunct tourist attraction adjacent to the Queen Mary, is underway.

Officials gathered at the site Monday morning to celebrate the occasion as crews ripped apart the structures, which have been the neighbor of the historic ocean liner for more than five decades.

Originally dubbed Mary’s Gate Village, the themed retail center was approved in 1972 and opened to the public in June 1974 with 40 shops and an English pub. The village also served as the entryway for visitors to the historic Queen Mary.

The one-acre village was designed in the style of medieval England by Vernon G. Leckman, who also designed Ports O’ Call. Estimates for construction were $1.5 million but the total cost was $2 million.

In the 1980s, most of the village was demolished, with the remaining structures falling into disrepair in the decades since.

“We are here to honor our past and build our future,”  said Mayor Rex Richardson, who called the village “outdated” and noted the structures were unsafe and posed safety concerns.

“Here’s to new beginnings,” Richardson added. “This is about transformation and setting the stage for an exciting future.”

Removal of the village, which is expected to be completed in May, will allow for additional parking and event space, according to city officials.

It's a summer of water activities in Central Long Beach, thanks to the reopening of the City’s newly renovated pool at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park (1910 Lemon Ave.).

On June 23, City leaders and community members joined together to celebrate the pool’s reopening just in time for the hot summer months. With the pool’s new amenities, community members of all abilities can engage in fun, recreational play, connect with friends and neighbors, and stay cool and active all summer long.

Reddit,safety,DTLB Apartment Recommendations,"I’m currently apartment hunting and have narrowed it down to the following:
	•	IMT Gallery 421
	•	RESA
	•	Burano
	•	Edison

Edison would be the most convenient for me since it’s right next to my workplace, but some of the negative reviews are giving me pause. Such as never getting a deposit back, noise from thin walls, recurring maintenance issues, etc.

All of these are fine for me distance-wise, so I’m more concerned about management quality, noise, safety, and overall living experience.

If you’ve lived in (or know someone who’s lived in) any of these, I’d love to hear your honest experiences — both the good and the bad.

Reddit,safety,Need asbestos and mold testing,"TLDR- need recommendations for local asbestos/mold testing companies and an idea of what they charge 

Long

If you read through my history you’ll see a lot more postings about how I came to this point, 

but the basic thing is after withholding rent and prevailing in an unlawful detainer lawsuit 

part of the officially filed with the court settlement agreement between myself and the landlord was that he would repair my unit, and have asbestos and mold testing done. 

He has done just a couple repairs and has not done any asbestos or mold testing even though now it has been over 12 weeks. The last repair was done in May, I have contacted him multiple times and he has not responded

There are three code cases on the property, one of which has been open for 16 months and the other two have been since February

I need to find a company to come and do asbestos testing on my ceiling, the insulation in the crawlspace above my unit, The windowsills that are degrading and three spots of the exterior façade which are crumbling

Once I have done that I know whether or not I need to do a civil court lawsuit, or if I can get away with just doing small claims court

I also need this for when I do hire a lawyer to represent me against my landlord

As a reminder to people who are not familiar with Long Beach, any Repair that needs a permit must be done by the landlord, or an authorized legal representative of the landlord. 

If I do the repair without getting a permit the landlord has the right to evict me, 

Even if the Repair I do is necessary for health and safety 

and Long Beach will not issue permits to anyone other than the landlord/property owner or their legal representative (so like construction companies have a sign off from the property owner which is how they get their permits)

I have been feeling sick for several years, and I feel worse if I’m in my apartment. If I’m in my apartment for more than 10 or 11 hours it feels a lot like I’ve got strep throat.

Something in this apartment is making me sick and I’ve lived here long enough that if it is asbestos I am at the edge of the time that cancer might start appearing

Reddit,safety,3701 Pacific Place EIR on City Council Agenda  - August 12,"**Only 3 days** until Long Beach City Council will vote on the Environmental Impact Report for 3701 Pacific Place. The developer’s **EIR fails to address the safety impacts** of their proposed RV storage lot and multi-story storage facility. Don’t let them push through an unstudied, polluting, **commercial development that puts our safety at risk.** 

**Now is the time to** **tell City Council to protect our safety and REJECT the EIR!**  

**PROPANE AND FIRE HAZARDS**

* **Propane fire hazards are real risks in RV facilities**. The site’s proximity to Los Cerritos Elementary School and residential neighborhoods poses a real threat.
* **The EIR fails to include safety measures** or best management practices for propane storage and refilling stations.

* **The site has seismic and soil liquefaction risks.** The storage of 550 RVs in the high-risk Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone, endangers both users and neighbors.

* **Regular inspections, proper ventilation, fire extinguishers, and clear escape routes are essential but not guaranteed.**

**The City Council should REJECT the developer’s EIR when propane and fire risks have not been fully evaluated!**

  
**FLOODING HAZARDS**

* The LA Basin Study identifies **climate vulnerability** and **overtaxed stormwater** systems as key **flooding risks** to our region.
* The proposed development will add acres of **impervious surfaces** with **no meaningful stormwater management** and is **in conflict with** ***The Enhanced Watershed Management Plan.***
* **The property is located in a flood-prone sub-watershed.** If used for green-space. the property would serve as a floodplain for nearby runoff, mitigating flood risks to surrounding areas.
* **Failure to mitigate flood risks along the LA River endangers thousands of local families.**

**The City must REJECT the EIR as it fails to model flood risks or propose adequate drainage infrastructure!**

**TRAFFIC SAFETY HAZARDS**

* **The EIR's traffic study fails CEQA's basic standards for protecting public safety at high-conflict intersections and trail crossings.**
* **Large RVs will create high-conflict traffic for horses, cyclists, and pedestrians on Wardlow Road.**

* **The EIR does not address a plan for safety barriers to separate RV traffic from historic bridle-trail users.**

* **RV traffic means increased danger for children walking to Los Cerritos Elementary along these routes.**

**The City must REJECT the EIR for its failure to include safety analysis and mitigation for the serious traffic risks the project brings to the community!**

It is the **responsibility and obligation** of our City Council to protect our community’s SAFETY when approving development. Make an official comment urging them to **REJECT the developer’s incomplete EIR** for the project at 3701 Pacific Place.

Reddit,development,"‘A tragedy’: 175 people laid off at Long Beach Memorial amid alleged budgetary shortfalls, leadership shakeup","Over 100 workers were notified Friday that they are being laid off from their jobs at the Long Beach Memorial medical campus, marking the second round of mass layoffs in the last year and a half.

A hospital spokesperson confirmed Saturday that 115 workers were notified that their positions at Memorial and Miller Children’s and Women’s hospitals were being terminated, which is in addition to 60 workers who were notified last month. The hospital notified the state of the layoffs in two separate filings with the California Employment Development Department.

“It was a terrible day. Memorial is losing very talented, loyal nurses, some who have spent their whole careers here,” one staff member wrote in a private social media group Friday. “It is a tragedy for them as well as our patients and our community. I am heartbroken.”

While some of those laid off were nurses, the hospital did not respond to questions regarding what other types of positions were affected by the layoffs. In an internal memo sent out Friday and obtained by the Watchdog, interim CEO Frank Bierne told staff that impacted workers’ final days would be between June 16 and July 1.

During a meeting Wednesday, hospital leadership announced “significant layoffs,” according to multiple sources who attended, including union representatives. At the meeting, executives said the hospital was facing a $40 million budgetary shortfall, despite layoffs and cuts in 2024.

A hospital spokesperson declined to comment on the financial state of the facility.

The internal memo also stated that the hospital’s blood donor center is to be shuttered “due to a decrease in blood donations.” Certain pediatric services are to be consolidated and streamlined to “improve care delivery.”

Some individuals “have been or will be redeployed to other positions within the organization through our Talent Acquisition job placement team,” the spokesperson stated Saturday, but the number of workers was not provided.

These moves come on the heels of a leadership shakeup on the medical campus. Late last year, Chief Operating Officer Todd Blake and Miller Children’s and Women’s Hospital Chief Executive Yair Katz allegedly got into an “altercation,” which resulted in both men being fired, according to staff members familiar with the incident who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The hospital declined to comment on the incident as it is an “internal personal matter.”

In a Jan. 21 letter to then-CEO Blair Kent, Miller Children’s staff urged him to reverse his decision to fire Katz, saying it caused “deep concern and disapproval.”

“[Katz] was widely regarded … as a remarkable and visionary leader,” the letter reads.

When Katz was not brought back, staff had a vote of no confidence in Kent, according to people familiar with the situation. The hospital spokesperson confirmed that Kent has taken a leave of absence, which staff members have attributed to the loss of support from employees.

Some individuals “have been or will be redeployed to other positions within the organization through our Talent Acquisition job placement team,” the spokesperson stated Saturday, but the number of workers was not provided.

These moves come on the heels of a leadership shakeup on the medical campus. Late last year, Chief Operating Officer Todd Blake and Miller Children’s and Women’s Hospital Chief Executive Yair Katz allegedly got into an “altercation,” which resulted in both men being fired, according to staff members familiar with the incident who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The hospital declined to comment on the incident as it is an “internal personal matter.”

In a Jan. 21 letter to then-CEO Blair Kent, Miller Children’s staff urged him to reverse his decision to fire Katz, saying it caused “deep concern and disapproval.”

“[Katz] was widely regarded … as a remarkable and visionary leader,” the letter reads.

When Katz was not brought back, staff had a vote of no confidence in Kent, according to people familiar with the situation. The hospital spokesperson confirmed that Kent has taken a leave of absence, which staff members have attributed to the loss of support from employees.

Reddit,development,"In Escrow, DTLB ... What do you think?","Hi neighbors! 

I live in Alamitos beach in a condo. My fiancée and I are in escrow for a house / lot in DTLB. Owners bought it in 2020 for 675K then tried to flip it for 1.6MM last year (probably assuming a developer would pay top dollar but no dice). They've been lowering the price ever since, and we found it listed at $1MM, got into escrow for about 900K.

The home inspection confirmed some major concerns: roof needs replacing, siding has issues, many sections in and out show wood rot. Plumbing and electrical are OK for awhile but will need many upgrades over time. 

  
We pictured living there for about 5 years, probably having a first kid, and we love the yard/garden most of all. If we got ambitious, we could try to borrow hard money and develop housing and become future landlords, but that would mean giving up the yard or most of it. 

To move now, we are only able to put 13% down, and we'll be spread thin on monthly cash flow (while now we save a responsible amount). Wonderful yard and location aside, we're afraid the juice isn't worth the squeeze. 

  
What do you think? I love Long Beach and will always have roots here. My fiancée was born here and loves it, too, but she grew up in Spain; we may head back there at some point as our family grows...

Long Beach is completely, totally, and with impunity violating the law, if Long Beach is just not going to follow the law when it comes to enforcement of housing code, an important thing since it keeps us all from dying in a fire or getting cancer from asbestos or our kids having to be on lifelong medication due to exposure to mold- there has to be a way to get the control of enforcement out of the hands of the city of Long Beach.

AB 548- (if a code inspector finds that one unit looking pretty bad, they have to inspect all the other units in the building in case they also look pretty bad- my building has a deteriorated building code case against it and a code case for my apartment for multiple issues including rodent infestation, guess whether or not the other three apartments have been inspected)

If the local enforcement agency determines the substandard condition could reasonably affect other units, the bill requires notice be given to the property owner, as specified, and the units reinspected to verify correction of the violations.

Reddit,development,I had an intuition Taco Sugar would not make it and a STRONG suspicion Plant Butcher would fail.,"I suspected Plant Butcher would fail because of the simple retail math even I know: Sales Per Square Foot. For the per month lease amount (I can only imagine how exorbitant it was) as compared to the square footage, Plant Butchers did not have NEARLY enough product on offer. They should have been as crammed with product as say, Olive Olives on Broadway near Redondo.  And that's the other thing. Olive Olives does catering/delivery which is a high mark up revenue stream. As far as I could tell Plant Butchers did not have that. A vegan ""butcher"" was a good concept but margins in the restaurant/food store industry are SOOOO slim that the proprietor must do everything right.

Which brings me to TACO SUGAR. It NEVER made sense to me. Not that the food was not good. The food was tasty. But anyone can go into ANY Latin cuisine restaurant and ask that in any meat dish the meat be substituted with more beans. 

That is not what TACO SUGAR was doing. They had developed recipes using tofu or some other plant based product to substitute for meat in the dishes. They knew what they were doing as far as flavor/texture/mouth feel. But what they had on offer was just not standout enough from any other Latin cuisine place for them to make it. Plus their hours. They, I guess, were counting on the lunch crowds. That is not a good bet in downtown Long Beach. There is a lot of competition. A place MUST stay open for dinner to make it down here. Plus that location. No street parking. And how many people knew off hand that Taco Sugar offered validation if you parked in the lot next door. I don't know that they did but IF they did that fact should have been on a HUGE sign in the window. If people think they have to pay to park and ALSO pay for their food, forget it.

Taco Sugar could have used an order ahead process where cars could just pull up and a person at the counter would come out and give them their prepaid order.

# It’s Time For Port Of Long Beach To Pivot On Renewable Energy

*The Port of Long Beach Should Pivot Away From Pier Wind Because Trump Is Purposely Trying To Kill It Altogether*

By Adreana Langston

Listen to the podcast episode about this article on Youtube: [https://youtu.be/HtROSWRIbOE?si=jicXC0P69VTytRKH](https://youtu.be/HtROSWRIbOE?si=jicXC0P69VTytRKH)

The Port of Long Beach/Los Angeles has been a leader in energy conservation, climate change and efficiency initiatives for some time. Back in 2006 POLB was one of the first major U.S. ports to implement a Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP).  And CAAP wasn’t just a press release. [The CAAP commitments were updated in 2010 and 2016](https://lacity.gov/highlights/ports-los-angeles-and-long-beach-unveil-bold-strategies-reduce-greenhouse-gases). CAAP included the POLB’s significant expansion into on-dock rail which included the ultimate goal of moving 50% of all port cargo out of the port by train rather than by truck.  POLB’s leadership carried over into support for innovative, au courant technologies. Back in 2016 POLB made a commitment to offshore wind energy.  The manifestation of that commitment was the announcement of the [Pier Wind Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IciUzcM6LHWFV0KpcJNdHf7L8KVGbyjb/view?usp=sharing). 

# The Pier Wind Project

Pier Wind is a partnership project between the Port of Long Beach, The California State Lands Commission and Humboldt Bay Harbor Recreation And Conservation District.  Working together the three entities plan to develop, the largest facility in the U.S. designed to accommodate the assembly of floating offshore wind turbines.  According to the [Pier Wind Brochure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IciUzcM6LHWFV0KpcJNdHf7L8KVGbyjb/view?usp=sharing):

*Pier Wind would involve creating 400 acres of new*

*land for a terminal capable of handling heavy-lift crane*

*operations to stage, store and construct some of the*

*world’s largest offshore wind turbines, standing as tall as*

*the Eiffel Tower.*



*The fully assembled turbines and foundations would*

*be towed by sea from the Port of Long Beach to federal*

*offshore lease areas 20 to 30 miles off the coast in Central*

*and Northern California, where they will harness strong*

*wind to generate energy for the electric grid.*



The predicted budget for Pier Wind is $4.7 billion.  In a [September 2023 interview with AJOT Insights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dvdjxqxey0vIy24415kViz0QuV1Wchs_/view?usp=sharing), Suzanne Plezia, Senior Director/Chief Harbor Engineer for the Port of Long Beach, stated that the Port of Long Beach's $4.7 billion Pier Wind offshore wind port project is projected to cost ""*$4.7 billion in 2023 dollars*"". On the issue of financing, she said that the Port brings public infrastructure that enables ""*the private equity...private equity will be enabled, but without the port infrastructure, it doesn't happen... The amount of public funding is the question ... I think it's going to be ... a mix of public and private. It's just state, federal, and private*""  . In that same interview Pleiza pointed to the [POLB Port Readiness Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sPby6O7Eav0zBocP9LsleO7c4z6cS73j/view?usp=sharing) saying that it lists all the domestic manufacturers of the parts that would be needed to actually construct the Pier Wind turbines and the concomitant pieces of equipment. Though Pleiza did say that, at first, sourcing would be from Asia. As of around [November 2024 around $21.5 million had already been outlaid for the project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ka4Q1WaygFaGZsrzOQ0ySAzah71FZh0lbYw04bVaN0/edit?usp=sharing).

So the Pier Wind Project would increase California’s grid resiliency in the face of increasing electricity demands (looking right at you AI industry), would help California meet its zero emissions goals and would add  8 billion dollars in cumulative labor income to California’s economy (according to page 26 of the [Pier Wind Presentation the POLB gave in February 2025](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dspMcJqkCZmc4AyBeoDuSTJybkmUEMX_/view?usp=sharing)). What’s not to like?  What’s not to like is that even though the POLB is pushing forward with its Pier Wind Project plan to start construction in 2027, there’s no assurance whatsoever that this project will be allowed to get fully implemented by the Trump Administration.  Trump’s open hostility to wind energy, plus the project's dependency on federal land and federal money, is enough of an obstacle for the POLB to abandon the project (but not the mission) and pivot.

# The Trump Administration Is On The Attack Against Wind And Solar Energy

Before Donald J. Trump even officially took office for his second term[ he stated “We’re going to try and have a policy where no windmills are being built,” adding, “They don’t work without subsidy. … You don’t want energy that needs subsidy.”](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trumps-windmill-ban-blows-nextera-energy-nyse-nee)  His statements caused stocks associated with the wind energy sector to decline and Trump has been steadily attacking wind and solar energy ever since. His attacks go beyond the verbal into weaponizing policy against wind and solar energy.

* The same day Trump was sworn in as POTUS [he signed an Executive Order ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jIdp7DXHaz_pJJYaCT_MOjziOEVMQGuG/view?usp=sharing)supposedly pausing all federal wind permit[s](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jIdp7DXHaz_pJJYaCT_MOjziOEVMQGuG/view?usp=sharing).  I say supposedly because the Trump Administration provided no timeline for lifting the “pause”.
* [*On Monday, July 7, the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would make a major offshore wind project, U.S. Wind, redo part of the permitting process because of a procedural issue*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jIdp7DXHaz_pJJYaCT_MOjziOEVMQGuG/view?usp=sharing)
* Trump’s Interior Department brags about cutting wind and solar off at the knees in a[ July 2025 report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdWRWlOMD5DZvou3pzbPyAOD1kRgftS9/view?usp=sharing): *”The Department of the Interior will ""eliminate longstanding right-of-way and capacity fee discounts for existing and future wind and solar projects, bringing an end to years of subsidies for economically unviable energy development.""”*
* Remember how Chief Harbor Engineer Pleizia said that, at first, parts for Pier Wind would be sourced from Asia? Well that’s the case for a lot of wind energy projects and Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill just made that sourcing a lot more challenging.[ The Big Beautiful Bill includes a ""Specified Foreign Entity"" provision, a ""Foreign-Controlled Entities."" provision a “Material Assistance Limitation” Provision and a ""Foreign Influenced Entity"" provision ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gwz-6E8qP3b8Bz5GRR3bPDwSzQghKBJt/view?usp=sharing)that may make it more difficult for the Pier Wind Project to attract foreign investment and nearly impossible to source manufactured components from Asia while remaining in compliance with the law.
* Trump Administration agencies are actively trying to de-finance climate related projects even though their attempts are coming up against legal challenges. In January 2025 the Office of Management And Budget tried to[ pause all federal financial assistance for climate related projects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bjMIB95NmH_D-eWNbIJ43y3xCslQKsH1/view?usp=sharing). Trump’s EPA tried to suspend clean energy disbursements.
* In the face of the Trump Administration attacks against wind energy, [developers are pulling back](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bjMIB95NmH_D-eWNbIJ43y3xCslQKsH1/view?usp=sharing). [Just this year developers have cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars of clean energy projects, including in wind and solar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OZG7okj40vm9TfDCl6vZdSEzo-UHPCNi/view?usp=sharing). [Investors are also being much more cautious](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcoPsmfGa8aMP1Gqm1P5YYRww_vrHWgz/view?usp=sharing).
* Oil and Gas backed groups are [using lawsuits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcoPsmfGa8aMP1Gqm1P5YYRww_vrHWgz/view?usp=sharing) (in which the Trump Administration often joins on the plaintiff’s side) to try and claw back federal money already granted to wind projects by the former Biden Administration.  

# The GOP attack on wind and solar is ideological in addition to the GOP being shills for oil and gas interests

To get a feel for how ideological the animosity is from the GOP towards wind and solar, read this excerpt from the July 25, 2025 episode of the podcast The Ezra Klein show. The guests were  two climate experts: Jesse Jenkins, who is a leading climate modeler and a professor at Princeton University, where he runs the Princeton ZERO Lab, and Jane Flegal, who is the executive director of the Blue Horizons Foundation and served on the Biden administration’s climate policy team.

**Flegal**: Jesse should jump in here because he’s in the weeds probably more than anyone I know. But the most significant damage in that bill for clean energy was to solar and wind — specifically, where the Republicans were quite punitive, actually. Which really shortened the timeline for solar and wind.

Anyone who has tried to build a large-scale piece of energy infrastructure will tell you that the work and time to even get to commence construction takes years. It’s a very long process.

What it means is that tax incentive is no longer sending a long-term signal to the market that there will be incentives for them to build. Instead, we have this mad rush.

**Klein**: So we’ve just decided to wreck the solar and wind industries going forward?

**Jenkins**: They even tried to go beyond that with the initial Senate draft by adding in a new tax — not just ending the tax cuts that basically lowered the cost of wind and solar by somewhere between 30 percent and 50 percent. So we’ve just raised taxes 50 percent on wind and solar — our biggest forms of new electricity generation. They actually proposed an excise tax on top of that to further penalize wind and solar beyond 2027.

# Staying the course on Pier Wind does not seem wise

With this level of Trump Administration animosity towards wind energy, it seems less than prudent for the POLB to go forward with the Pier Wind Project. And I say this even as California State officials were, as recently as February 2025, [talking very promisingly ](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/02/21/california-policymakers-say-theyre-undeterred-by-trump-opposition-to-offshore-wind/)about staying the course with offshore wind in California.  I don’t think those officials are just pandering. They say they are looking at the long term and they think California’s plans will outlast the Trump Administration. They are probably correct. But I’m not confident that the country will soon recover from the Trump Administration. Nor am I certain my fellow Americans won’t again vote into office someone with a strong disregard for the rule of law, or the norms of not using the power of the law for vindictiveness or personal gain or a non-science based prejudice against wind and solar energy. I think there are ways for California to keep pushing forward with its zero emissions goals using energy sources for which the Trump Administration has not shown outright antagonism. 

# There is a spot of beauty for Long Beach in the Big Beautiful Bill

While the Big Beautiful Bill did gut tax incentives for wind and solar energy, it did not gut tax incentives for all clean energy initiatives. If an electricity producer can claim it is zero emissions, it's still eligible for the investment tax credit for clean energy, again, as long as it is not wind or solar. [Jane Flagel explains this in the interview on the Ezra Klein show.](https://youtu.be/vuW4PdhqKmo?si=W5nDdENyPQtZuvva&t=658)

Long Beach, California has at its disposal two potential forms of zero emission energy generation that are not wind and not solar.

# Pumped Hydro Storage Energy

[Pumped Hydro Storage Energy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IBFCQhuhkgdYfUp2xQZg9aDwUTIFcskW/view?usp=sharing), also called underground pumped hydro storage (U-PHS), storing energy by pumping water to a higher elevation (or pressurizing an underground aquifer) and then releasing it through turbines to generate electricity when needed. 

The three THUMS islands off the coast of Long Beach could be perfectly repurposed for this. In fact,  Bob Dowell, the City's Director of Energy Resources even mentioned using the THUMS islands for this purpose in [an article about the future uses of Long Beach's THUMS oil islands](https://lbpost.com/news/oil-island-long-beach-reused-discussed/).

*“Dowell said that electricity generation is also a possibility. That process would include pressurizing underground aquifers with water and allowing it to rise up through an impeller at night when electricity is in high demand but solar is not an option. Tha19t could provide the city with a new source of clean energy. But all of these ideas are conceptual as of now""*

While the immediate context of Dowell's statement refers to generating electricity directly from the pressure, the underlying principle aligns with pumped hydro, which stores energy by pumping water to a higher elevation (or in this case, pressurizing an underground aquifer) and then releasing it through turbines to generate electricity when needed.  And this is not a new principle. It’s already being workshopped at municipalities here in Southern California.

The San Diego County Water Authority, in partnership with the City of San Diego, is evaluating the feasibility of [developing a pumped storage energy project at the San Vicente Reservoir](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16fC599mDi0eFnTF7eObWHPRAhQ-n3gpJ/view?usp=sharing). Lancaster is working with a[ 2 million dollar grant from the California Energy Commission ](https://www.energy.ca.gov/filebrowser/download/2099?fid=2099) to fund a demonstration of an Aquifer Pumped Hydro (APH) system. The project is intended to help understand APH and define its value and benefits, especially for disadvantaged and low-income communities. The [design and construction tasks on the Lancaster project are completed ](https://www.energizeinnovation.fund/projects/long-duration-50-kw-energy-storage-aquifer-pumped-hydro)and it is nearly ready to launch.  Pumped Hydro Storage may be cutting edge but it is not so edgy that projects are 5 years or more out from being deployed. Using THUMS islands for U-PHS is a goal that could be reachable within fewer than five years after THUMS islands are decommissioned if Long Beach were to quickly make a commitment to starting the project.

# Ocean Wave Energy

There is, already, *right now*, an on-shore ocean energy pilot project at Port of Los Angeles. [ It is called EcoWave and it is at Berth 70 in San Pedro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uVqTjahrlVqWweGRlEYOiA8hDb_fysAQ/view?usp=sharing). The official “unveiling” is scheduled for September 9, 2025 but the project, finished ahead of schedule, is up and running now after having been[ awarded a permit from the Port of Los Angeles in March 2025](https://drive.google.com/file/d/128MjVh3zBi4HX2kr_uRy9q8cJmWIq5Co/view?usp=sharing). 

Ocean wave energy uses the [kinetic energy of the tides to generate electricity](https://www.ecowavepower.com/our-technology/how-it-works/).  On-shore ocean wave energy is much more affordable than offshore ocean wave energy implementation. No ships are needed, nor divers, nor underwater moorings, nor cables. The machinery does not have to be as robust as offshore where the open ocean can be very rough. The machinery is made to attach to a jetty or a breakwater or a concrete pier where the grid infrastructure is already right there to accept the generated electricity.  The actual machinery for EcoWave’s Los Angeles project is [produced right here in California by a woman owned company](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1On8ibE9-I8cI5BjsAGtx3EraDpfjg4uj/view?usp=sharing) so none of the federal restrictions on sourcing will be an obstacle.

The EcoWave pilot project will be small. It will only generate enough electricity to power about 80 homes. But once the proof of concept is proved, it is not that challenging  to scale.

The best part of on-shore ocean wave energy is that it is a lot less prone to federal government disruption.  It is implemented at jetties and ports and breakwaters, not on federal ocean land where permits are needed. Because it is installed right in the built environment on or near the shore, interference with marine life is not an issue. So the environmental regulations the Trump Administration is currently cynically using to thwart offshore wind projects would be less likely to apply.  Its relative affordability makes it easier for municipalities wanting to use on-shore wave energy to find enough investors to fund projects.

The EcoWave project is at the Port of Los Angeles but it is not being run in conjunction with the Port of Los Angeles or Long Beach or any municipal entity.  [A non-profit called AltSea](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17yi3JX52LlD5t4jP8NsVvvQwdKqLOW5l/view?usp=sharing), which is a business incubator for start ups in the ocean based climate change solution industry, is hosting the EcoWave pilot program. The Port of Long Beach and the City of Long Beach would be extremely wise to pay close attention to the EcoWave pilot program and to begin a partnership with EcoWave right away.

# The stalking horse of high energy prices and grid failures

The reason it would be wise for the City of Long Beach and the Port of Long Beach to get in *now* on the pivot away from offshore wind energy and into some other form of zero emission energy that is not being attacked by the president of the United States is simple. Energy prices for the average resident or business of Long Beach, California are going to rise.  What’s also going to rise is the occurrence of [2015 style Long Beach Blackouts](https://lbpost.com/news/city-of-long-beach-and-socal-edison-to-test-power-tonight-in-hopes-of-ending-blackout-2/). Jesse Jenkins and Jane Flegal [explain it in that Ezra Klein podcast episode I referenced earlier](https://youtu.be/vuW4PdhqKmo?si=8TM2RMobJK8Kq0aH&t=1916): Jenkins and Flegal explain the risk associated with growing electricity demand.  They attribute this growth to, obviously, AI. But less obviously they attribute it to the fact that with the passing of the Big Beautiful Bill, now many fewer EVs will be on the road, now many fewer solar panels will be installed generating electricity, now many fewer wind turbines will be installed as well. They warn of the risk of energy prices going up in response to this increased demand. They also warn of brown out and black out grid failures in response to extreme weather events, which will grow more frequent as climate change continues to wreak havoc. Jenkin’s Princeton ZERO Lab models predict “*On average, a 15 percent increase in retail bills. But, of course, that can be 2 percent in some states and 30 percent in other states. . . . The other thing that’s going to happen, though, because we’re deploying less electric vehicles, we’re going to consume more gasoline and diesel nationally, and that’s going to drive up gas prices at the pump, too. The estimates of that could be on the order of a 5 percent increase in gasoline prices.”* 

I am proud of Rob Bonta for joining the 16 other state attorney generals who are suing the Trump Administration arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to halt project permitting and doing so jeopardizes the states' economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals. And as of June 2025 a federal judge has ruled against the Trump Administration asking that the case be dismissed. It’s good that states are standing up to an Executive Branch that is overreaching its authority.  I am proud but not hopeful.  I’ve seen the Trump Administration wantonly disobey judge’s orders. I’ve seen the Trump Administration use stall tactics. I’ve seen the Supreme Court give Trump’s Executive branch sweeping authorities that other legal scholars find hard to justify.

In the best case scenario the House and Senate swing majority DNC after the midterms and the legislative branch of government reasserts its authority.  But then what?  The Trump Administration has so gutted the federal agencies or so stocked them with right wing ideologues that I do not believe federal money will start flowing back to states anytime soon even if the midterms result in a DNC landslide. I do not believe federal permits for ocean areas will start flowing any time soon after a DNC midterm victory either. The administrative state will take time to build back up. It will take a DNC majority House and Senate time to legislatively unwind the Big Beautiful Bill. And that projected $4.7 billion budget?  Those projections were modeled before the tariff regime installed by Trump. No matter what the mid terms bring the Executive branch does have the authority to set tariffs.  So whatever financing the managers of the Pier Wind project thought they needed will have to be increased as long as these Trump Tariffs are in place.

But what for sure will start happening even before the midterms is those cost of living increases Jenkins and Flagel explained. Because the increase in demand for electricity is happening now, with the exponential growth of AI.  The slow down in EV sales and the slow down in clean energy projects is happening now, as the attacks by the Trump Administration continue. 

There are many, many people in Long Beach, California suffering right now under the high cost of living. Rents are still way too high and groceries prices have not decreased the way Trump promised they would if he won. Long Beach leaders and Port of Long Beach leaders would be remiss to ignore a pivot to a clean energy solution at their doorstep that might help keep blackouts or brownouts from happening and might help keep electricity prices low.  I’d love to see them pivot all the way to clean energy municipal power.

There has already been $21 million spent on the Pier Wind project but sunk costs are not a reason to keep going forward. In fact, having only spent $21 million is a great reason to pause the Pier Wind project now. California had already spent $15 billion on high speed rail when Trump came into office and clawed back $4 billion promised in federal funding, effectively killing the project.  Since Trump is dead set against wind energy, the Pier Wind project should be paused now, at $21 million spent rather than spending even more only to have the Trump Administration find some way to kill the project altogether.

California can and will win the war on emissions.  Long Beach, CA and the Port of Long Beach in particular can and will continue to be innovative leaders in clean energy.  Pivoting away from the particular battle for offshore wind and towards other readily available renewables that can be implemented right here in Long Beach is a savvy move in winning the overall war.

# It’s Time For Port Of Long Beach To Pivot On Renewable Energy

*The Port of Long Beach Should Pivot Away From Pier Wind Because Trump Is Purposely Trying To Kill It Altogether*

By Adreana Langston

Listen to the podcast episode about this article on Youtube: [https://youtu.be/HtROSWRIbOE?si=jicXC0P69VTytRKH](https://youtu.be/HtROSWRIbOE?si=jicXC0P69VTytRKH)

The Port of Long Beach/Los Angeles has been a leader in energy conservation, climate change and efficiency initiatives for some time. Back in 2006 POLB was one of the first major U.S. ports to implement a Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP).  And CAAP wasn’t just a press release. [The CAAP commitments were updated in 2010 and 2016](https://lacity.gov/highlights/ports-los-angeles-and-long-beach-unveil-bold-strategies-reduce-greenhouse-gases). CAAP included the POLB’s significant expansion into on-dock rail which included the ultimate goal of moving 50% of all port cargo out of the port by train rather than by truck.  POLB’s leadership carried over into support for innovative, au courant technologies. Back in 2016 POLB made a commitment to offshore wind energy.  The manifestation of that commitment was the announcement of the [Pier Wind Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IciUzcM6LHWFV0KpcJNdHf7L8KVGbyjb/view?usp=sharing). 

# The Pier Wind Project

Pier Wind is a partnership project between the Port of Long Beach, The California State Lands Commission and Humboldt Bay Harbor Recreation And Conservation District.  Working together the three entities plan to develop, the largest facility in the U.S. designed to accommodate the assembly of floating offshore wind turbines.  According to the [Pier Wind Brochure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IciUzcM6LHWFV0KpcJNdHf7L8KVGbyjb/view?usp=sharing):

*Pier Wind would involve creating 400 acres of new*

*land for a terminal capable of handling heavy-lift crane*

*operations to stage, store and construct some of the*

*world’s largest offshore wind turbines, standing as tall as*

*the Eiffel Tower.*



*The fully assembled turbines and foundations would*

*be towed by sea from the Port of Long Beach to federal*

*offshore lease areas 20 to 30 miles off the coast in Central*

*and Northern California, where they will harness strong*

*wind to generate energy for the electric grid.*



The predicted budget for Pier Wind is $4.7 billion.  In a [September 2023 interview with AJOT Insights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dvdjxqxey0vIy24415kViz0QuV1Wchs_/view?usp=sharing), Suzanne Plezia, Senior Director/Chief Harbor Engineer for the Port of Long Beach, stated that the Port of Long Beach's $4.7 billion Pier Wind offshore wind port project is projected to cost ""*$4.7 billion in 2023 dollars*"". On the issue of financing, she said that the Port brings public infrastructure that enables ""*the private equity...private equity will be enabled, but without the port infrastructure, it doesn't happen... The amount of public funding is the question ... I think it's going to be ... a mix of public and private. It's just state, federal, and private*""  . In that same interview Pleiza pointed to the [POLB Port Readiness Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sPby6O7Eav0zBocP9LsleO7c4z6cS73j/view?usp=sharing) saying that it lists all the domestic manufacturers of the parts that would be needed to actually construct the Pier Wind turbines and the concomitant pieces of equipment. Though Pleiza did say that, at first, sourcing would be from Asia. As of around [November 2024 around $21.5 million had already been outlaid for the project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ka4Q1WaygFaGZsrzOQ0ySAzah71FZh0lbYw04bVaN0/edit?usp=sharing).

So the Pier Wind Project would increase California’s grid resiliency in the face of increasing electricity demands (looking right at you AI industry), would help California meet its zero emissions goals and would add  8 billion dollars in cumulative labor income to California’s economy (according to page 26 of the [Pier Wind Presentation the POLB gave in February 2025](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dspMcJqkCZmc4AyBeoDuSTJybkmUEMX_/view?usp=sharing)). What’s not to like?  What’s not to like is that even though the POLB is pushing forward with its Pier Wind Project plan to start construction in 2027, there’s no assurance whatsoever that this project will be allowed to get fully implemented by the Trump Administration.  Trump’s open hostility to wind energy, plus the project's dependency on federal land and federal money, is enough of an obstacle for the POLB to abandon the project (but not the mission) and pivot.

# The Trump Administration Is On The Attack Against Wind And Solar Energy

Before Donald J. Trump even officially took office for his second term[ he stated “We’re going to try and have a policy where no windmills are being built,” adding, “They don’t work without subsidy. … You don’t want energy that needs subsidy.”](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trumps-windmill-ban-blows-nextera-energy-nyse-nee)  His statements caused stocks associated with the wind energy sector to decline and Trump has been steadily attacking wind and solar energy ever since. His attacks go beyond the verbal into weaponizing policy against wind and solar energy.

* The same day Trump was sworn in as POTUS [he signed an Executive Order ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jIdp7DXHaz_pJJYaCT_MOjziOEVMQGuG/view?usp=sharing)supposedly pausing all federal wind permit[s](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jIdp7DXHaz_pJJYaCT_MOjziOEVMQGuG/view?usp=sharing).  I say supposedly because the Trump Administration provided no timeline for lifting the “pause”.
* [*On Monday, July 7, the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would make a major offshore wind project, U.S. Wind, redo part of the permitting process because of a procedural issue*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jIdp7DXHaz_pJJYaCT_MOjziOEVMQGuG/view?usp=sharing)
* Trump’s Interior Department brags about cutting wind and solar off at the knees in a[ July 2025 report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdWRWlOMD5DZvou3pzbPyAOD1kRgftS9/view?usp=sharing): *”The Department of the Interior will ""eliminate longstanding right-of-way and capacity fee discounts for existing and future wind and solar projects, bringing an end to years of subsidies for economically unviable energy development.""”*
* Remember how Chief Harbor Engineer Pleizia said that, at first, parts for Pier Wind would be sourced from Asia? Well that’s the case for a lot of wind energy projects and Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill just made that sourcing a lot more challenging.[ The Big Beautiful Bill includes a ""Specified Foreign Entity"" provision, a ""Foreign-Controlled Entities."" provision a “Material Assistance Limitation” Provision and a ""Foreign Influenced Entity"" provision ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gwz-6E8qP3b8Bz5GRR3bPDwSzQghKBJt/view?usp=sharing)that may make it more difficult for the Pier Wind Project to attract foreign investment and nearly impossible to source manufactured components from Asia while remaining in compliance with the law.
* Trump Administration agencies are actively trying to de-finance climate related projects even though their attempts are coming up against legal challenges. In January 2025 the Office of Management And Budget tried to[ pause all federal financial assistance for climate related projects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bjMIB95NmH_D-eWNbIJ43y3xCslQKsH1/view?usp=sharing). Trump’s EPA tried to suspend clean energy disbursements.
* In the face of the Trump Administration attacks against wind energy, [developers are pulling back](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bjMIB95NmH_D-eWNbIJ43y3xCslQKsH1/view?usp=sharing). [Just this year developers have cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars of clean energy projects, including in wind and solar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OZG7okj40vm9TfDCl6vZdSEzo-UHPCNi/view?usp=sharing). [Investors are also being much more cautious](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcoPsmfGa8aMP1Gqm1P5YYRww_vrHWgz/view?usp=sharing).
* Oil and Gas backed groups are [using lawsuits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcoPsmfGa8aMP1Gqm1P5YYRww_vrHWgz/view?usp=sharing) (in which the Trump Administration often joins on the plaintiff’s side) to try and claw back federal money already granted to wind projects by the former Biden Administration.  

# The GOP attack on wind and solar is ideological in addition to the GOP being shills for oil and gas interests

To get a feel for how ideological the animosity is from the GOP towards wind and solar, read this excerpt from the July 25, 2025 episode of the podcast The Ezra Klein show. The guests were  two climate experts: Jesse Jenkins, who is a leading climate modeler and a professor at Princeton University, where he runs the Princeton ZERO Lab, and Jane Flegal, who is the executive director of the Blue Horizons Foundation and served on the Biden administration’s climate policy team.

**Flegal**: Jesse should jump in here because he’s in the weeds probably more than anyone I know. But the most significant damage in that bill for clean energy was to solar and wind — specifically, where the Republicans were quite punitive, actually. Which really shortened the timeline for solar and wind.

Anyone who has tried to build a large-scale piece of energy infrastructure will tell you that the work and time to even get to commence construction takes years. It’s a very long process.

What it means is that tax incentive is no longer sending a long-term signal to the market that there will be incentives for them to build. Instead, we have this mad rush.

**Klein**: So we’ve just decided to wreck the solar and wind industries going forward?

**Jenkins**: They even tried to go beyond that with the initial Senate draft by adding in a new tax — not just ending the tax cuts that basically lowered the cost of wind and solar by somewhere between 30 percent and 50 percent. So we’ve just raised taxes 50 percent on wind and solar — our biggest forms of new electricity generation. They actually proposed an excise tax on top of that to further penalize wind and solar beyond 2027.

# Staying the course on Pier Wind does not seem wise

With this level of Trump Administration animosity towards wind energy, it seems less than prudent for the POLB to go forward with the Pier Wind Project. And I say this even as California State officials were, as recently as February 2025, [talking very promisingly ](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/02/21/california-policymakers-say-theyre-undeterred-by-trump-opposition-to-offshore-wind/)about staying the course with offshore wind in California.  I don’t think those officials are just pandering.

Jenkin’s Princeton ZERO Lab models predict “*On average, a 15 percent increase in retail bills. But, of course, that can be 2 percent in some states and 30 percent in other states. . . . The other thing that’s going to happen, though, because we’re deploying less electric vehicles, we’re going to consume more gasoline and diesel nationally, and that’s going to drive up gas prices at the pump, too. The estimates of that could be on the order of a 5 percent increase in gasoline prices.”* 

I am proud of Rob Bonta for joining the 16 other state attorney generals who are suing the Trump Administration arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to halt project permitting and doing so jeopardizes the states' economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals. And as of June 2025 a federal judge has ruled against the Trump Administration asking that the case be dismissed. It’s good that states are standing up to an Executive Branch that is overreaching its authority.  I am proud but not hopeful.  I’ve seen the Trump Administration wantonly disobey judge’s orders. I’ve seen the Trump Administration use stall tactics. I’ve seen the Supreme Court give Trump’s Executive branch sweeping authorities that other legal scholars find hard to justify.

In the best case scenario the House and Senate swing majority DNC after the midterms and the legislative branch of government reasserts its authority.  But then what?  The Trump Administration has so gutted the federal agencies or so stocked them with right wing ideologues that I do not believe federal money will start flowing back to states anytime soon even if the midterms result in a DNC landslide. I do not believe federal permits for ocean areas will start flowing any time soon after a DNC midterm victory either. The administrative state will take time to build back up. It will take a DNC majority House and Senate time to legislatively unwind the Big Beautiful Bill. And that projected $4.7 billion budget?  Those projections were modeled before the tariff regime installed by Trump. No matter what the mid terms bring the Executive branch does have the authority to set tariffs.  So whatever financing the managers of the Pier Wind project thought they needed will have to be increased as long as these Trump Tariffs are in place.

But what for sure will start happening even before the midterms is those cost of living increases Jenkins and Flagel explained. Because the increase in demand for electricity is happening now, with the exponential growth of AI.  The slow down in EV sales and the slow down in clean energy projects is happening now, as the attacks by the Trump Administration continue. 

There are many, many people in Long Beach, California suffering right now under the high cost of living. Rents are still way too high and groceries prices have not decreased the way Trump promised they would if he won. Long Beach leaders and Port of Long Beach leaders would be remiss to ignore a pivot to a clean energy solution at their doorstep that might help keep blackouts or brownouts from happening and might help keep electricity prices low.  I’d love to see them pivot all the way to clean energy municipal power.

There has already been $21 million spent on the Pier Wind project but sunk costs are not a reason to keep going forward. In fact, having only spent $21 million is a great reason to pause the Pier Wind project now. California had already spent $15 billion on high speed rail when Trump came into office and clawed back $4 billion promised in federal funding, effectively killing the project.  Since Trump is dead set against wind energy, the Pier Wind project should be paused now, at $21 million spent rather than spending even more only to have the Trump Administration find some way to kill the project altogether.

California can and will win the war on emissions.  Long Beach, CA and the Port of Long Beach in particular can and will continue to be innovative leaders in clean energy.  Pivoting away from the particular battle for offshore wind and towards other readily available renewables that can be implemented right here in Long Beach is a savvy move in winning the overall war.

With stirring melodies, tributes to veterans, and a sense of unity, the beloved band’s patriotic concert is a cherished tradition that honors our nation’s history and spirit.

**Week 3 (July 8-11)** “**The Movie Music of James Horner” –** This week’s concert features the movie music of James Horner, one of Hollywood’s most iconic composers. Whether it’s the haunting beauty of Legends of the Fall or the intensity of The Rocketeer and Apollo 13, listeners will be immersed in Horner’s timeless music.

**Week 5 (July 22-25) “Viva La Fiesta” –** This week’s celebration of Latin music will bring vibrant rhythms and melodies to life. Salsa, bossa nova and mariachi will showcase the rich harmonies that define the genres. From fiery brass solos to pulsating drumbeats, the concert highlights classics from Latin artists and composers.  Becoming an instant crowd favorite last year, L. Young brings his dynamic vocal range and versatility across R&B, soul and pop.

**Week 6 (July 29-Aug. 1) “Symphonic Popcorn” –** This week’s concert will take audiences on a musical journey from the sweeping themes of Broadway to the infectious beat of rock and concluding with the tradition of classic marches. With virtuosic solos, rousing ensemble moments, and a few surprises, we conclude our season with an unforgettable night of exhilarating music. The summer season will conclude with the multi-talented Nicole Kubis fronting the Studio Band with her infectious style, keeping the party going into the night.

I’ve helped organize protests during BLM and the George Floyd Protests with a few Asian American grassroots orgs and 501(c)(3)s in the Philadelphia area, along with working to establish myself as a helping arm and volunteer for 50501 SoCal and 50501 LBC. 

I wanted to extend an invitation to anyone who is interested in protesting but also a little worried by what they see in the media. Yes, protesting can be dangerous at times and can come with consequences like being arrested, but if you believe that getting arrested for speaking your mind and voicing concerns is more important than sitting in your home, you’re the person I’m looking for.

Reddit,parking,PSA: Parking Enforcement will tow your car (and cost you a whole lot of money) over an expired tag.,"Mostly posting this to make other people aware but also out of frustration. 

Parking Enforcement spent over a month singling me out for minor infractions. I work from home. Every 48 hours, like clockwork, if I didn’t move my car from a street parking spot, I would get chalked (they also put a card on your windshield telling you that it’ll be towed if it’s not moved by the 72nd hour)

After being chalked 3 times I got hip to their game and started moving at least every day and a half. 

Then, my registration lapses because a costly repair prevented me from passing smog. Keep in mind, I paid my registration fee to the DMV. I have a notice of incomplete registration. I woke up to a $65 ticket for expired tags.

Frustrating but my fault, fine. I’m saving for the repairs, let me shell out the $65-plus-convenience-fee fine to pay my debt.

Less than a week later, my car’s been towed. I only know because I searched the tow yard’s website with my license plate. If I were to go pick it up today, it’d be $417, and every day it stays in their lot is an additional $78.

Thankfully, this is a car I’ve been trying to get rid of. So I’m going down to the tow yard to sign over my title so they can auction it and I can collect my belongings from the back seat. But the problem is that this system is designed to keep poor people down, and to single people out. Every day there are people parking on red curbs on my street. Every day people with expired tags park on my street. Not a single one of them has even gotten a warning. Someone at Parking Enforcement decided they didn’t like my car and made it their mission to make my life hell.

How am I supposed to pay for engine repairs when I’m shelling out ticket fees and tow/storage costs? If this were my main vehicle I’d have to miss work and pay hundreds if not thousands, and if I didn’t fix it immediately after driving it off the lot I know they’d be back tomorrow, or next week.

I hope this saves someone else some heartbreak because I’m done parking on these streets. Hope they enjoy my car cause I sure as hell didn’t enjoy owning it here.",83,50,2025-07-10 02:08:07,https://reddit.com/r/longbeach/comments/1lw11j3/psa_parking_enforcement_will_tow_your_car_and/,"PSA: Parking Enforcement will tow your car (and cost you a whole lot of money) over an expired tag.

Reddit,parking,Driveway Parking Ticket,"We received a ticket and appealed it. Our appeal was rejected citing “LBMC 10.22.02, no person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle within any sidewalk and/or parkway” Which is the LBMC code verbatim, however it continues “It includes any portion of the vehicle that is within any public right-of-way, ie side walk which could hinder pedestrians, strollers, and/or handicapped persons from the clear path of travel.” 

We parked our car in our driveway. Tires were ON the driveway with the front portion of the car overhanging the sidewalk. My understanding of their citing LBMC 10.22.02 is that the wheels have to be parked on the sidewalk for it to be a violation. 

Question: Has anyone took this to an Administrative Hearing and won?  My argument is that their addendum is not the written code. While it may be an “intention” it is not in the code and therefore not an executable situation. 

For those curious: we live in Alamitos Beach. Parking in a driveway overlapping a sidewalk while be annoying is a way most people park here and after living in this neighborhood for 10+ years, this is the first ticket I have received for this.

Reddit,parking,Willow Springs Park Takeover,"
Go get the box!
Look for the GREEN LABEL

If you wind up at the park this morning, and are able to walk around, it’s got a lot of local history about the Tongva tribe posted all around the park.

So What are these random
Boxes stuffed with free merch? 

Let me explain…
Who am I? I grew up in Long Beach, went out to Hollywood  after highschool to navigate the movie and tv world and try to make one. The path seemed obvious, write some scripts, and a rich suit will stop me on the street and ask for said script, and then in turn bless me up with at least a million to make this first feature of mine. That never happened.

Fast forward, I went back to my vault of scripts I had written over the years, found the one that I was supposed to make for nothing, so I did. No budget, no crew, just a relentless amount of favors, and artists willing to come on board for the sake of the story; and SORRY came to life. 

A full length feature, 76 minutes runtime.
17 actors, a handful of locations, all shot on iPhone. 

So what does this all have to do with random boxes stuffed with free merch?
So I shot the movie with no budget, because i didn’t have a budget, and also into just really needed to make a movie. Because I had no budget to shoot, I really don’t have a budget to market this thing. 
And I’m doing distribution in house, garage Long Beach dot style, and putting it on my website for $5.99 VOD at the end of the month. Essentially going toe to toe with the studio giants for attention and clicks. And since I don’t have money to advertise directly against them, I’m going the diy, Long Beach on my back, let’s show em what the Guerilla’s are capable of, route. 

I can’t just expect someone to wind up on my website, and even more so, just blindly pay $5.99 for a product you know nothing about or frankly don’t give a shit about either. So I’m trying to change that. I want to give you a reason to care, support, all that good stuff. So I stuffed these boxes with as much stuff as I could, hats, t shirts, stickers, sweatshirts, etc.. all designed and printed in the garage, DIY5000. 

First to the box, first to take it. Happy hunting. 
And thank you for supporting local-longbeach-independent-guerilla-movie-making. 

And some news if you’re still reading, we’ve locked down an official release party for the 9.25 and will be announcing more on that soon. Mark your calendars, there will be a screening, tastings, and the cast from SORRY. 

Just when you thought your day couldn’t get any worse, it does.

SORRY
this summer

Shot on iPhone. Feature-length.
No crew. No budget. No apologies.
This is not a film. It’s a f***ing MOVIE.

Long Beach’s only Guerilla movie CR3W. 🎬🦍

# GOOD TROUBLE LIVES ON: Trump National Golf Course

[Rally](https://www.mobilize.us/john-lewis-actions/?event_type=16) · Volunteer organized

# Time

**Thursday, July 17**5 – 8pm PDT

# Location

**Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles**1 Trump National Dr[Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275](https://www.mobilize.us/john-lewis-actions/?country=US&state=CA)MapH

# PARKING 

By law, the Trump Course has a free public parking lot just inside the entrance to the Course, on the left side of the driveway. If that's full then you can drive East a little to La Rotunda Drive which leads to another public parking lot before the Course. It's a relatively short, easy walk from there.

# About this event

Good Trouble Lives On is a national day of nonviolent action to respond to the attacks posed on our civil and human rights by the Trump administration and to remind them that in America, the power lies with the people.

On July 17, the anniversary of Congressman John Lewis’s passing, we’re taking action across the country to defend our democracy and carry forward his legacy of Good Trouble.

From voter suppression bills like the SAVE Act to the criminalization of protest, the Trump administration is launching a full-scale attack on our civil and human rights. But we know the truth: in America, the power lies with the people, and we’re rising to prove it.

This is more than a protest; it’s a moral reckoning. A continuation of the movement Lewis helped lead, and a new front in the struggle for freedom.

**Please note:** A core principle behind our Good Trouble Lives On actions is a commitment to nonviolence in all we do. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.",683,284,2025-07-15 01:19:35,https://reddit.com/r/longbeach/comments/1m04khb/protest_at_trumps_golf_course_this_thurs/,"PROTEST AT TRUMP'S GOLF COURSE THIS THURS.

Reddit,parking,"This Saturday, Poetry in the Park","**Back by popular demand, this Saturday I will lead us in a FREE small group creative writing nature workshop out in a Long Beach park!** Join us for a refreshing morning walk through nature to learn about native ecosystems through writing, drawing, and creative field research! Enjoy the trees, the breeze, and creative release.

We’ll meet at Willow Springs Park and take a light walk around the grounds, stopping occasionally to explore plants, talk with each other, hear poetry, and do a short poetry/nature writing/drawing exercise.

**You may be interested in this event if you:**

* could use some sunshine and trees to ground and uplift
* want to learn about our native land and respond with creativity
* want some fresh poetry or creative writing inspiration
* would like to have a small, intimate gathering to meet new friends
* care about the environment, climate change, and local plants and ecosystems

No experience necessary! At the end of our walk, we’ll rest in the shade and have a longer time to write, then share in a supportive environment. Notebooks and pens will be provided.

Please wear appropriate walking shoes, dress for warm, sunny weather, and bring a water bottle, as well as snacks if needed. Meet at the entrance near the parking lot at 9 am. Please be advised the only bathroom is a porta potty on the other side of the park. This activity does involve standing and walking on uneven ground for an extended period of time.

Please reach out with any questions or accessibility requests. Participants will be invited to showcase their work with City Fabrick for a culminating event celebrating the Neighbor to Neighbor program.

We recognize the Tongva people as the original stewards of this land, and honor their wisdom and knowledge of local ecology. This event is free but registration is strongly encouraged. See you there!

Lady across the street audibly calls 911, give my vehicle description, and my clothing description (bright pink shirt btw). She says I'm scoping out the neighborhood looking to steal shit. 

I had been ignoring her for the most part, she was smoking like a chimney as if she was pissed about something, so maybe she was angry I was parked across the street from her house and wouldn't leave, as she happened to be right next to the shul. I flashed her a glance like ""wtf"" and she gave me an evil staredown then went back into her home.

I called LBPD myself and told them what's going on, what I'm doing and everything. A unit swung by anyways, cop hopped out and said ""you're doing nothing wrong. Code 4, let's go"". Cop disappeared as fast as they responded.

Probably the most uneventful interaction with LBPD thus far.

Funny the shul says on top for ""all people"" being a reform Jewish temple but apparently right next door there is an odd possible anti-Semite. 

Should I call DHS on her and make a complaint? Ahah no, that's what fear mongerers do, push paranoia that everyone is suspect. No wonder ICE be grabbing kids from school and ziptieing them. Maybe she was angry I didnt wear a Jewish star on my pink shirt so she could id me me to the authorities. /s",191,139,2025-10-04 21:54:56,https://reddit.com/r/longbeach/comments/1ny6pw9/belmont_heights_racist_or_what/,"Belmont Heights racist or what?

Reddit,parking,At home Euthanasia,"Yesterday we said Goodbye to our Bernadette. She was 16 and in January was diagnosed with a MCT on her liver. Because of her age, heart murmur and cost we decided to give her the best life possible after consulting with our vet. This past week she got so sick. Was barely eating or drinking water, and she had this look in her eye. So we knew it was time. She only wanted chicken so her last dinner and breakfast consisted of a rotisserie chicken. Yesterday we took her to the park and beach. She loved chasing squirrels and she mustered up the strength to chase after two squirrels. But she was tired. We took her to Rosie’s and normally she would run up and down the beach. This time she just stood there. She did try to dig a little. But she didn’t have it in her. Her appointment was at 3pm so we brought her home, gave her a bath and took her to the groomer to get her nails trimmed and we asked to put a bow in her hair. We laid out a blanket with some of our cloths in our 2nd bdrm which we called Bernie’s room. She got up from her blanket and laid on the clothes. We laid down with her comforting her and telling her how much we loved her and how she was such a good girl. The doctor came promptly at 3 and the whole process took about 30m. We used Laps of Love and I can that her transitioning at home was the only option we considered and we’re both glad we did. Dr. B Ankone was so professional, compassionate and reassuring. We don’t think she would have made it through the night. The life in her eyes was fading. She lets us know that Bernie wasn’t in pain but uncomfortable due to the size of belly. Hence her laying on her stomach. My husband and I both cried while I held her paw and he sang to her and caressed her head. She passed peacefully and quickly surrounded by her dads and surviving sister. If you can afford it and you need to make a decision about your fur baby definitely consider laps of love and doing it at home. The comfort in knowing she was at peace and in a familiar place was priceless. Also thank you Dr. Alyssa at pine animal hospital for always taking care of her and checking in on her. You and the staff there always made her feel comfortable when she came in for an appointment. We’ll miss you Bernadette.

Reddit,parking,‘Punk’s not dead’: Band arrested for guerilla show outside Warped Tour Long Beach,"More than 80,000 music lovers flocked to Downtown Long Beach over the weekend for the Vans Warped Tour, a punk-rock festival that’s celebrating its 30th anniversary. But the most punk moment of the weekend came after day two of the event when the band Who Cares were arrested for playing an illegal show on Pine Avenue.

The Venice Beach-based rock trio had played in the same spot — the intersection of Pine Avenue and Bay Street — Saturday night with no incident, according to singer Omar Sandlin, 29. The second night, however, garnered a “significantly bigger” crowd, he said.

“In the final song I said ‘fuck the cops,’” Sandlin said with a laugh. “[Police] were like, ‘Dude, we were going to be cool with you until you did that.’ That’s pretty on brand for a pig to even say that dumb shit to me.”

Long Beach police confirmed that officers were dispatched to the intersection around 10:15 p.m. due to a large crowd. Video from the scene shows more than a dozen police vehicles parked around the hundreds of people who had gathered around the band just outside the Pike Outlets.

A police helicopter also made an appearance, Sandlin noted, comparing the scene to the video game “Grand Theft Auto.”

Police said the “large crowd, which spilled into the southbound lanes of Pine Street,” was obstructing traffic.
The band ignored police commands to stop the performance, the department says. The band, for its part, told the Watchdog that they did not hear any commands over their music and the crowd.

After finishing its 30-minute set, the three band members — Sandlin, bassist Elijah Napuri, 27, and 15-year-old drummer Julian Crawford — were arrested and transported to Long Beach Beach City Jail.

Crawford was cited for obstructing a crosswalk and disturbing the peace, and was released to a parent, the LBPD said. Sandlin and Napuri were booked for one count of disturbing the peace, one count of obstructing a crosswalk with a vehicle, and cited for conducting an unpermitted event, according to police.

Social media exploded with footage of the post-Warped show and subsequent arrests, with hundreds of comments of support.

“Punk’s not dead,” one commenter wrote, while another said Who Cares was “the punkiest band of the Warped Tour (and they weren’t even in the lineup).”

the group’s stunt outside of Warped Tour was not meant to be “performative,” Sandlin added, noting that they did not think they would be having a run-in with the law.

“We’re just willing to get arrested for our fucking shit,” he said. “We’re always going to be proud for not fucking backing down.”

Reddit,parking,Lagoon takeover pt.2,"Another Saturday, another FREE(99) MERCH DROP for the beach! Look for the green label, “YOU!”

This, again? Only got 3 more drops until the movie comes out and then you won’t be seeing these anymore, that is until the next movie! *insert obligatory evil laugh here* 

So what is this exactly? 
After years of chasing, I finally put my head down, walked through the door, and made a feature length, 76 minute movie, no crew, no budget, just a bunch of favors and a relentless passion and yearning for this crazy dream of mine. After almost 20’years of chasing, I finally just did. 
I shot the movie in May, and it will be out for everyone to see on September 25th.

Gotta bunch of local music on the soundtrack; Falling idols, Shortbus, Clash, the Minutemen, Ras-1 and more, it’s a good time. 

Anyhowwwww, so making the movie is only half the battle. Eye balls and rentals are just as important. Since the wife and I are doing distribution ourselves, DIY everything! We are putting the movie on our website for $5.99 essentially competing with the big streaming services for your clicks and support. 

And this is where this branding and drop thing comes into play, i print a bunch of merch up in the garage, pack it into boxes and scatter them around parks throughout Long Beach for yall to find, sport, support, and spread the word about EL PRIMO BRAND, our production company. 

Why the production company and not the movie? 
SORRY, was the 5th screenplay of my 6. I want to make all of them and then some come to life. I would love to do this forever, and I would love to do it in the beach, forever. Hoping that if this works to any capacity, we’ll be able to make more movies going forward.

Some news to leave you with…
We’ve been fortunate to link up with some awesome local businesses in the community to get these thing in front of as many of you as possible and got some cool stuff planned for the near future here in the community. 
At the end of the month we have a big release party planned at WILLE’S TIN SHOP presented by LONG BEACH WATER. 
And just linked up with LONG BEACH BEER LAB as well, and are planning some stuff with them. Huge shout out to Beasties, and Patricios LB as well, the support has been unreal 🙌🏽

We’re really trying to build something here and can’t thank you enough for supporting local Long Beach independent movie making.

Reddit,housing,Warning For Students Looking For Housing!!,"**This Is A Repost But A New Update Is That He HAS Been Reported To The Fair Housing Foundation**

BEWARE of Kevin Cwayna — Landlord in Long Beach, CA (Hackett Ave area)

If you’re a student or tenant looking for housing, DO NOT RENT from Kevin Cwayna. He manages a property on Hackett Avenue and creates an unsafe, invasive, and hostile living environment. Kevin frequently enters the home without 24-hour notice, often outside of business hours (which are defined as Monday–Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM), and has a pattern of controlling and inappropriate behavior. He has previously removed access to the kitchen, including taking out the entire stovetop, as a form of punishment. He’s also had verbal altercations, yelled at tenants, and asked invasive, personal questions, including about my sex life.

When a tenant attempted to stand up for their rights, Kevin responded by trying to reclassify them as a “lodger” — a manipulative and misleading tactic meant to strip them of legal protections. This is not only unethical, it borders on illegal.

California Civil Code § 1954: Landlords must give 24-hour written notice before entering and may only enter during business hours (Mon–Fri, 8 AM–5 PM).
 • Civil Code § 1940.2: Prohibits landlords from engaging in harassment, intimidation, or retaliation against tenants.
 • Civil Code § 1927: Protects your right to quiet enjoyment and privacy in your rental.

Reddit,housing,"Federal agents raid 2 Long Beach car washes, videos show","Workers at two Long Beach car washes showed up for their shift Sunday morning just like any other day, but the lives of at least nine people were upended when federal agents raided the businesses and detained them.

Videos from both raids show masked federal agents swarm Andres Car Wash in Cal Heights and Coast Hand Car Wash near Cal State Long Beach between 10 and 11:30 a.m. Sunday, causing workers to flee. It’s unclear if the agents were with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection or a combination of the two agencies.

“They don't say anything. They don't ask anything. They just … go straight to the employees,” one Andres worker, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Watchdog Monday. The worker added that agents did not show warrants or other paperwork before chasing down workers.

The worker said four people were taken into custody, including one man who has worked at the car wash for about 15 years. They said all the detained employees are hard workers just trying to provide for their families.

Both car washes remained closed Monday.

“We don’t have enough employees to open,” the Andres worker said, adding that remaining employees are scared to come to work because agents have been known to return to the same location in the days after a raid. “We don’t know when we’re gonna be back open.”

The worker noted that agents have made a habit of picking up immigrants throughout the region while they are at work, which counters the notion that they are lazy and living off government assistance. They said that they pay taxes and receive little if any assistance but they are just happy to have jobs.

“In summertime, do you know how hard this job is?” the worker said. “We’re sweating, we get dirty, but we don’t complain.”

The Long Beach Police Department declined to comment on the raids, deferring questions to the Department of Homeland Security. DHS did not immediately respond to questions asked by the Watchdog.

In a statement released Monday, the Mayor’s Office said it’s aware of the weekend raids.

“We know how frightening and destabilizing this can be for many of our immigrant families and neighbors, and we want you to know that you are not alone,” the statement reads. “The City of Long Beach is not notified in advance of any such actions and does not cooperate with immigration enforcement operations. We strongly condemn any activity that targets, intimidates, or inflicts fear on our immigrant community.”

Reddit,housing,"Black Long Beach Residents, Buy A Whole Home Air Filter","Those of you familiar with my YouTube channel are already aware of my video explaining the history of how the majority of African Americans in Long Beach are clustered in the most air polluted areas near the 710 corridor.
""From Redlining To Environmental Racism"" https://youtu.be/L--NcdAP6BE?si=XCt9MMuuz0mbD9Un

Wellllll, things are going to get progressively worse along the 710 corridor. Check out this excerpt from a May 22, 2025 article on the NPR website.

The Senate has overruled the guidance of the parliamentarian, a nonpartisan staffer who interprets the Senate's rules, and voted 51 to 44 to overturn a waiver allowing California to set its own air pollution standards for cars that are stricter than national regulations. The Senate has only overruled its parliamentarian a handful of times in the 90-year history of the role.

The Senate also voted to revoke two waivers related to heavy-duty trucks. One allowed California to mandate zero-emission trucks, and the other permitted stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks.

Congress is using a law called the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, as a mechanism to revoke the federal waivers that allowed California to set these rules. The House previously approved three resolutions to revoke the waivers.

In April, more than 100 public health and environmental groups sent a letter to Congress saying that blocking the California standards would mean ""more children suffering asthma attacks and missing school, more grandparents dying prematurely, and more death and destruction from extreme weather.""

On Thursday, environmental and EV groups assailed the votes, and in particular the move to revoke the waiver relating to passenger cars.

""From Redlining To Environmental Racism"" https://youtu.be/L--NcdAP6BE?si=XCt9MMuuz0mbD9Un

Wellllll, things are going to get progressively worse along the 710 corridor. Check out this excerpt from a May 22, 2025 article on the NPR website.

The Senate has overruled the guidance of the parliamentarian, a nonpartisan staffer who interprets the Senate's rules, and voted 51 to 44 to overturn a waiver allowing California to set its own air pollution standards for cars that are stricter than national regulations. The Senate has only overruled its parliamentarian a handful of times in the 90-year history of the role.

The Senate also voted to revoke two waivers related to heavy-duty trucks. One allowed California to mandate zero-emission trucks, and the other permitted stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks.

Congress is using a law called the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, as a mechanism to revoke the federal waivers that allowed California to set these rules. The House previously approved three resolutions to revoke the waivers.

In April, more than 100 public health and environmental groups sent a letter to Congress saying that blocking the California standards would mean ""more children suffering asthma attacks and missing school, more grandparents dying prematurely, and more death and destruction from extreme weather.""

On Thursday, environmental and EV groups assailed the votes, and in particular the move to revoke the waiver relating to passenger cars. ""This illegitimate move poses threats to public health, the economy and states' rights,"" the Union of Concerned Scientists wrote in a statement. The Zero Emission Transportation Association, which represents electric automakers, called the waiver repeal ""an extraordinary action that sets a dangerous precedent.""

Industry groups are celebrating. The American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers dubbed the repeal of that waiver ""a massive win for consumers and working families all across the country.""

Reddit,housing,So Many Roadblocks… Can anyone help us find our first rental in LB?,"Hey LB community,

My partner (51M) and I (37F) are relocating from Atlanta to California this fall, and we’ve been hitting wall after wall trying to secure a rental. I’m hoping someone here might have advice, leads, or even just insight on how to navigate this, because we’re feeling discouraged and reaching out here for hope, encouragement, and guidance.

Our situation:
	•	Budget: Up to $3,200/month.

	•	Size/Type: 2 bedroom, Preferably 750 sq. ft. or larger. Ideally a house with a small grassy yard, or an apartment/ADU with greenspace or a park nearby. We don’t mind a smaller place if there’s a nice park for walks. Conversely, we’d also be happy with a yard even if the area itself isn’t highly walkable.

	•	Dog: We have one dog, Maya — a 3.6-year-old spayed Daniff (great dane/mastiff mix), about 115 lbs. She’s gentle, people+dog-friendly, fully up to date on vaccinations, trained, and a true gentle giant. She’s been part of our family for 3 years, and we can provide vet records and references if needed. 

*Earlier this year, Maya tore her CCL and had a big surgery to repair it- we came back this weekend from a 10 day trip to view rentals in LB and that same night she blew out her opposite leg and is scheduled for surgery again next week. Her recovery will be 12+ weeks before she’s fully mobile again, so we need a ground floor unit or home where she won’t have to manage stairs during healing.

Income background:
	•	We’ve owned our home in Atlanta for 5+ years and are under contract to close its sale on Sept 22. That will give us a substantial cash reserve to pay rent well in advance — we’re willing to pay 3–6 months upfront if needed.
	•	My partner is a carpenter/musician but had major spinal surgery earlier this year and had to stop carpentry while he heals. He was originally on unemployment but has been working at Whole Foods for the past 2–3 months and has already secured a transfer to a store in LB, where his wages will be higher. He also has savings of over $12k in addition to our home sale.
	•	I’ve bartended for years (with gratuities/tips making up the bulk of my pay — taxed and clearly listed on my paystubs), while building my photography business from the ground up for several years. I’m beyond burned out from the past decade of bar work (teetotaler of 8+ years!) and actively transitioning into taking my photography biz full time. I already have confirmed contracts lined up in Cali for every weekend in October thru the end of Dec this year. 

The roadblocks:
Most big property management companies and complexes only want to see the past 2–3 months of income history. That hurts us because:
	•	My partner’s Whole Foods income looks meager compared to his prior wages, even though he has steady work and savings.
	•	My bartending income is seasonal/show-based (slower from June–August every year), so my recent paystubs look “weak” even though the rest of the year is solid.
	•	Many companies have also refused to consider my gratuities/tips (despite being taxed income on my submitted paystubs) nor the proceeds from our upcoming home sale.

On paper, that makes us look like we don’t meet the rigid “3x rent” rule, and many are hard lining us on the fact that they want it in W-2 wages no matter our other means, even though in reality we’re stable, responsible, and more than capable of paying. We’ve even been denied despite offering to pay several months upfront, which has been frustrating and dehumanizing. I’ve really felt emotionally brutalized by this whole process, as if I’m too poor or incompetent to deserve to pursue my dream of living in Cali. I’ve always busted my ass to meet my bills and support myself, I’ve never been without a job except during the pandemic, and in 2021-2022 I tried working 7 different part-time jobs (yes, all at once) to get ahead and that didn’t work out or help ultimately either.  I’m not willing to give up, I believe there has to be a way, but lately all the denials have me feeling like I’m simply not enough. :(

Our search so far:
We just spent the past 10 days in LA and Long Beach touring properties we were excited about, and unfortunately, we faced rejection at every place we applied to either due to our lack of W-2 income or our dog being over 30lbs. We came away heartbroken because we know we’d make excellent tenants, but the rigidity of large companies keeps shutting us out.

This move is deeply personal. Both of us have dreamt of living in California for literally decades, long before we met. Now, after 9+ years together, it finally feels like the right time. We’re utterly burnt out on Georgia and the South, (and red states in general) and disappointed by what Atlanta has offered us long-term. What pulls us west is California’s diversity, opportunities, better weather and access to national parks, nature, and varied landscapes. We want a stable home here with our dog as a family, and to build the life we’ve both envisioned for so long.

What we’re looking for:
We’d love to find a dog-friendly home where a landlord can see beyond corporate formulas and understand our situation. Ideally a small independent landlord, duplex, guest house, or privately managed rental in or around Long Beach — but we’re also open to nearby LA neighborhoods.

We’re reliable, responsible tenants who live a quiet and harmonious life. We can provide references, proof of funds, proof of contracts for upcoming work and employment, and vet/training records for Maya.

If anyone has leads, knows of a compassionate independent landlord, knows of a large dog friendly management co or has advice on navigating this without ending up with a slumlord or shoebox, we’d be so grateful.

Thanks so much for reading.

Reddit,housing,Decluttering Services on here - Beware,"Hello everyone! I just wanted to post an update to a post of someone here on Reddit who is posting services for decluttering. She posted last week about starting a decluttering business which is why I’m posting on Reddit I want to warn people. She has since deleted her post so I can’t warn people there. I really needed these services and had been wanting to hire someone for awhile so I decided to take a chance on a new small business and hire her. I saw her post, reached out and then she called me, after discussing a fee($500) we decided on a time, which was this last weekend. I was excited! Our house is clean but very cluttered because I have a 4 year old and newborn. When she and another person came over, I started to tell her what I was looking for. I really wanted a Montessori style space where my son could see where his toys were and easily access them. This would be hard as he has a lot of large oversized toys but that’s why I hired a professional! I figured she could come up with solutions and figure something that worked for our family. Well things got off the rails pretty fast. Whereas I wanted things to be open to easy to see her plan was basically just to shove everything into boxes and hide everything. She also didn’t take care of items and things that belonged together, she just threw into a box with no regard for intent. There were MANY cases like this where she separated things that belonged together and created an even further disaster for us. I have no idea where most things are in my house right now, the exact opposite of what we wanted. I have been texting her for a week asking where specific items are that are missing. They are not valuable items but the point is, I should more easily be able to find things and I instead have lost a lot of things. I literally have looked everywhere. After messaging her 3 times on Sunday, I attached the texts, she cancelled on me mid project. Our house is a HUGE mess now because she was supposed to come finish the project and has instead bailed on me. Way worse than before. We purchased over $1000 in organization items that she recommended to complete the project and now we either have to hire someone else or do days of work by ourselves which is the opposite of what we wanted. All of this to say, don’t hire people you find on reddit! And specifically don’t hire this girl. I feel so stupid, sad, depressed and angry because I lost $250 which I could have used toward a professional who would have known what they were doing(I kindly offered to pay her $250 for her work so far and then $250 once the work was complete before I realized a ton of items were lost/misplaced). She came on a Saturday and we scheduled for her to finish on Wednesday(tomorrow) to finish everything and then today cancelled.

Reddit,housing,We’re colonizing Mars but tenants still can’t get protection from mold.,"I’ve been researching mold for months and what I’ve learned has made me furious. Not just for myself but for every tenant who’s gotten sick and gaslit for it. I work in brain science and have seen the actual neurological changes in my own brain from living in a moldy home near the ocean for the last eight months. It’s devastated my immune system, my energy, my ability to think clearly. And no one seems to care...not landlords, not lawmakers, not even most doctors.

To make things worse, last week I hired a mold inspector to come to our house. At best he was a complete scam. At worst his business was a front for casing homes in an affluent area. And through this whole mold process I’ve learned something disturbing. Because landlords can sue mold inspectors many of them would rather give you vague incomplete lab results that are as good as nothing than risk telling the truth. I’m not saying all of them do this but too many do. And it is part of why this issue keeps getting swept under the rug.

There is a functional medicine doctor in Newport Beach I know of. Mold is the number one reason patients come to her. Professionals, athletes, executives, families with kids. Mold wrecks lives. It is a silent saboteur. People don’t realize how insidious it is until it is too late. And what’s even worse It’s almost impossible to prove unless you already know what you’re looking for. Even then landlords will dismiss you. Why? Because legally they still can.

In California the last time mold was meaningfully addressed in law was back in 2016...nearly a decade ago. And even that bill SB 655 only required landlords to act if visible mold is present. That’s laughable if you understand how mold works. Much of it hides in walls crawl spaces insulation HVAC units...completely invisible but still harmful.

Meanwhile there has been no major mold legislation in nearly 10 years. None. Not a single update. How is it that we’re living in the era of AI smart homes and space exploration yet renters still have no protection when it comes to mold? It’s a public health crisis and no one with power wants to talk about it. Probably because they own property.

Let’s talk about symptoms. Mold can mimic anxiety. Depression. Asthma. Autoimmune flares. Brain fog. Chronic fatigue. Unexplained weight loss. Or weight gain. It can tank your nervous system and make you question your sanity. And if your body doesn’t detox mold properly...thanks to genes like MTHFR...it builds up in your brain, your lungs, your gut, your tissues. You can end up like me. Unable to take a deep breath in your own home, and stuck in a lease you can't get out of.

Where I live, many of the homes are old beach cottages built in the 1940s or earlier. Some haven’t been renovated in decades. Others have been lipstick renovated...made to look nice inside but still hiding ancient plumbing, rotten beams, moisture damage, or decaying ventilation. This isn’t just about aesthetics. It’s about biology.

To make it even more complicated not everyone gets sick from mold. Some people might live in a moldy home and feel totally fine. Others like me might lose their entire quality of life. It depends on your genetics, your immune system, and how long you’ve been exposed. That’s why people get dismissed...because symptoms don’t always look the same. But that doesn’t make them less real.

This post is for anyone who has ever felt sick in their home and been ignored, dismissed or blamed for it. If you’ve lived somewhere with mold in Southern California, please please comment below. If we can get enough people to speak up, I believe we could push for local legislation. The city could lead the way where the state has failed. All it takes is a loud enough voice.

And honestly maybe it's time we all get together and organize something. Something visible, public, grounded in science and compassion....and impossible to ignore.

Let’s stop treating mold like it’s a personal problem.  
It’s a public one. And it’s way past time we did something about it.",72,33,2025-08-19 21:43:23,https://reddit.com/r/longbeach/comments/1muw2oy/were_colonizing_mars_but_tenants_still_cant_get/,"We’re colonizing Mars but tenants still can’t get protection from mold.

My summer break is approaching next week.

I’m 20F, on the lookout for some quick cash or a fun summer job—something flexible, chill, or just downright interesting. I’ve got good vibes, a strong work ethic, and a knack for picking things up fast. 

I’m a spontaneous kind of gal so even if it’s something totally random—I’m in.

Reddit,housing,Updated Post : WARNING LANDLORD,"⚠️ UPDATED POST: BEWARE of Kevin Cwayna – Landlord in Long Beach, CA (Hackett Ave Area)

If you're a student or tenant looking for housing, I strongly recommend avoiding renting from Kevin Cwayna. Based on my experience and the experiences of others, his management of a property on Hackett Avenue created an unsafe, invasive, and stressful living environment.

During my tenancy, Kevin repeatedly entered the home without providing the 24-hour written notice required by California Civil Code § 1954—often doing so outside of legal business hours (Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM). He also removed access to basic amenities, including taking out the entire stovetop as a form of punishment. 

Kevin engaged in verbal altercations with tenants, frequently raising his voice and creating a hostile atmosphere. He also asked invasive and inappropriate personal questions, including about my private and intimate life—something no landlord has any right to inquire about. These interactions were uncomfortable, unprofessional, and crossed serious boundaries.

When tenants tried to assert their legal rights—such as pushing back against illegal entries or withholding of amenities—Kevin attempted to reclassify them as “lodgers.” This is a manipulative and misleading tactic that can be used to strip tenants of legal protections under California law. In my case, it appeared to be a direct retaliation for standing up for my rights as a renter.

After I moved out in April 2025, Kevin initially attempted to withhold part of my security deposit, claiming “defamation of character” in response to posts like this—even though I was simply sharing truthful and documented experiences. I ultimately received my full deposit back only after informing him I would pursue the matter in small claims court. Under California Civil Code § 1950.5, landlords may only withhold a deposit for specific reasons like unpaid rent or property damage—not as a punishment for exercising free speech or reporting misconduct.

California tenant protections include:

✅ Unlawful Entry – Civil Code § 1954

✅ Harassment, Intimidation & Retaliation Protections – Civil Code § 1940.2

✅ Right to Quiet Enjoyment – Civil Code § 1927

✅ Fair Return of Security Deposits – Civil Code § 1950.5

These are my personal experiences, and I share them to protect other students and renters from going through the same thing. Everyone deserves housing that is safe, respectful, and free from harassment or retaliation.

Know your rights. Protect your peace. And be cautious when renting from Kevin Cwayna.

""[How California sent residents’ personal health data to LinkedIn](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2025/04/28/how-california-sent-residents-personal-health-data-to-linkedin)

The state’s health insurance exchange transmitted pregnancy and domestic abuse data during a marketing campaign. It is reviewing its website practices.""

  
And below is the follow up article from CalMatters from July 2025

Citing [an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2025/04/28/how-california-sent-residents-personal-health-data-to-linkedin), lawmakers in the House of Representatives are questioning why California’s state health insurance exchange shared sensitive health data with LinkedIn.

In [a letter sent last week](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25981632-06-17-2025-letter-to-covered-california-3-a64f1928e0/) to Jessica Altman, executive director of the state’s exchange, the lawmakers write they are “deeply concerned about the privacy and security implications” raised by a Markup and CalMatters story [published in April](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2025/04/28/how-california-sent-residents-personal-health-data-to-linkedin).

The story showed through forensic testing how the exchange, Covered California, used trackers that told LinkedIn when visitors entered health information like whether they were blind, pregnant, or used a high number of prescription medications into the website coveredca.com. 

The trackers, which operated for more than a year as part of a marketing campaign before being removed, also logged information like whether visitors were transgender or possible victims of domestic violence.

Kentucky Congressman Brett Guthrite, who chairs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, sent the letter alongside four other Republican lawmakers. “The Committee seeks to understand how such sensitive data could have been transmitted through advertising trackers, what oversight existed to detect or prevent it, and whether Covered California took appropriate steps to protect consumer information,” the lawmakers wrote.

The other signatories are Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter of Georgia, who chairs Energy and Commerce’s health subcommittee; Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama, who chairs the oversight and investigations subcommittee; Rep. Gus M. Bilirakis of Florida and California Rep. Jay Obernolte. 

The letter said “the extended period of data exposure raises serious questions about the adequacy of safeguards that Covered California had in place.” Those “circumstances warrant examination of Covered California’s actions under federal privacy standards,” including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the letter continued. 

As part of the Affordable Care Act, states must offer health insurance through exchanges that allow residents to shop for and purchase health care plans. States can either let the federal government operate those exchanges or maintain their own, as California and 18 other states do. 

In California, millions of people rely on the exchange to find their coverage. But unbeknownst to those signing up for care, the exchange’s website used a tool called the “LinkedIn Insight Tag” that sent answers to potentially sensitive questions to the tech company. The tag is widely used for advertising purposes but LinkedIn explicitly prohibits using it to share health data.

In response to The Markup and CalMatters’ reporting, [Covered California said](https://www.coveredca.com/newsroom/news-releases/2025/04/28/statement-on-data-and-information-sharing/) the exchange had inadvertently shared the data and that it had instituted a review of practices. As the review happens, the organization said that it has paused its use of trackers entirely. 

The investigation immediately triggered an outcry. One House lawmaker [asked in a letter](https://mrkp-static-production.themarkup.org/uploads/2025/05/CA-ACA-HIPAA-Investigation-Letter-4.30.25.pdf) to the Department of Health and Human Services whether the practice may have violated HIPAA. [A proposed class-action lawsuit](https://themarkup.org/impact/2025/05/02/after-markup-investigation-linkedin-and-google-face-lawsuit-alleging-improper-access-to-health-data) against LinkedIn and Google alleging privacy violations was also filed one day after the story was published.

Since then, a followup investigation by The Markup and CalMatters found [four other state exchanges](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2025/06/17/we-caught-4-more-states-sharing-personal-health-data-with-big-tech) also sharing information with tech companies. The stories were produced as part of a series called [Pixel Hunt](https://themarkup.org/series/pixel-hunt), examining the unexpected ways websites share data.

A spokesperson for Covered California said they had received the letter and planned to respond by the committee’s deadline of July 1st. A spokesperson for LinkedIn declined to comment.

The lawmakers asked Covered California to provide answers and documents in response to several questions about the organization’s data privacy practices, as well as its use of web trackers generally. The questions included what data was sent to LinkedIn, how many people were affected, and how or whether those affected will be notified.

“Ensuring the confidentiality of health information is a foundational obligation for entities operating within the health insurance ecosystem,” the lawmakers wrote.

Reddit,traffic,A bridge too far? Vincent Thomas plans put Port of L.A. at odds with locals,"A cut and paste from pay walled LA Times article:

As officials ponder whether to spend at least a year and $1.5 billion more on an already ambitious upgrade of the Vincent Thomas Bridge, locals are asking if the mess they will have to endure during construction will be worth it.

Soon after the California Department of Transportation shared plans to fix up the more than 60-year-old bridge that connects downtown Long Beach to San Pedro and Terminal Island, the Port of Los Angeles piled on with even bigger plans.

Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of L.A., suggested Caltrans also raise the height of the symbol of the locality by 26 feet.

Raising the bridge would allow larger cargo ships to pass under its deck, helping create jobs and keep the port relevant. It would also increase the project’s price, already projected at more than $700 million, by an additional $1.5 billion.

Most painfully for local commuters and businesses, it would mean the bridge will be closed for around 28 months rather than the originally planned 16 months.

About 40% of the port’s cargo container capacity is beyond the bridge, which is 185 feet high. Raising the bridge to 211 feet would accommodate the next generation of cargo ships, which will be larger and more energy efficient, Seroka said.

Big buildout begins at Port of Long Beach amid global trade uncertainty
July 11, 2025
“You’re going to need more capacity at the nation’s largest port,” he said. “Caltrans was looking to resurface the bridge and we thought maybe there was a way you could accomplish both.”

Seroka said he has already secured private funding from banks and industry participants to raise the bridge by putting sleeve lifts and platforms on the bridge’s legs.

The Bayonne Bridge connecting Staten Island, N.Y., and Bayonne, N.J., was raised in a similar manner in 2019.

While the Port of Los Angeles has garnered support for the idea, many communities surrounding the bridge have raised concerns about travel disruptions and the effect of rerouted traffic.

Closing the bridge for more than two years would require an alternative route for cargo trucks traveling to and from the port, and would likely affect tourism across San Pedro and Long Beach.

“It’s not only for employees going back and forth through the port complex,” said Elise Swanson, president of the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce. “The bridge is really a connection to our communities for art, culture, dining.”

In August, the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce voted to support a study of the effects of raising the bridge.

Swanson said she saw the merits of raising the bridge while acknowledging the disruption the project would have, particularly to Wilmington residents, where truck traffic would be rerouted.

Preliminary detour routes would send commuters, tourists and cargo through Harry Bridges Boulevard in Wilmington and on the 110 and 405 freeways.

“We’re all in agreement on the study and getting all the facts in front of us,” Swanson said. “If we’re going to go through all of this work and spend this money on fixing the current bridge, is that really a good expenditure of funds if the bridge won’t meet future needs for the shipping industry?”

Caltrans is expected to decide on the bridge raising in October, following a late September meeting with the Port of Los Angeles. The $706 million re-decking project is slated to begin next year and will also replace the bridge railings, fences and median barrier.

Los Angeles City Councilmember Tim McOsker, who represents port-adjacent communities including Wilmington, Harbor City and San Pedro, said he supports raising the bridge as long as it is safe and takes locals’ needs into account.

“In the years that it would take to come up with the plans, the financing and the environmental review for raising the bridge, we have to think about the traveling public in the meantime,” he said.

Under its original plans, Caltrans hoped to reopen the bridge to traffic in late 2027 or early 2028, in time for the 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

If the bridge is raised, it would likely not be done before the Olympics, making it harder for the tourists to visit that corner of Los Angeles.

The Pacific Merchant Shipping Assn., which represents marine terminal operators, says raising the bridge is worth the trouble.

“We would like to see the bridge’s useful life increased,” Pacific Merchant Shipping Assn. President Michael Jacob said of the Vincent Thomas Bridge, which opened in 1963.

Increasing the port’s capacity and ability to accommodate larger ships would boost job opportunities by about 20% for longshoremen, truckers, warehouse workers and terminal operators, Seroka said. The newest and largest container ships are also the most environmentally friendly, he said.

Caltrans declined to comment on its decision-making process regarding the bridge raising and directed questions about the bridge to the Port of L.A.

“Caltrans is focused on delivering a needed bridge deck replacement project and is collaborating with our partners on those efforts,” the department said in a statement.

McOsker said his constituents are waiting on a decision.

“Making the bridge higher with a greater clearance is really important to industry and the workforce, but it also has significant time implications and significant cost implications,” McOsker said. “Caltrans will have to speak for themselves.”

Reddit,traffic,I'm Conflicted About This Gathering,"Coming back from dropping off a 101 year old church sister in Lakewood after service. The day was sunny but brisk. My partner is driving. We are cruising downhill on Redondo. At the corner of 7th and Redondo I see this gathering while we are waiting at the stoplight.

My boyfriend says ""Come on light. Get us outta here before these fools pull out."" And my inner sentiment is the same. We have previously been driving on PCH when a group riding these kinda bikes road among traffic in a way that was really dangerous to other drivers.

But mostly, I just hate these bikes because I hate the noise they make. I genuinely can't stand that super loud high pitch these bikes make. Many a WALK along the beach bike path at night in downtown Long Beach has been ruined for me by these bikes riding back and forth.

So on the 1 hand I look and see not a license plate among them and I wonder if it is even legal for them to be riding these on public streets without a license plate displayed. My boyfriend wonders out loud how many of them have the specific driver's license to ride a motorcycle. Who knows?

On the OTHER hand. I see grey bearded men. I see boys. I see women. I see girls. I see very fat people. I see fit and medium build people. This looks like a cross generational, cross gendered, cross bodied activity that could build community and doesn't necessarily require one to be athletic. So that could be a positive. There are certainly far more destructive ways for groups of young people, boys especially , to spend their time on the street .

Reddit,traffic,Reminder: the Long Beach Marathon is coming up! (10/04-10/05),"This is your friendly reminder to plan your travel routes accordingly for **Sunday, October 4** as the marathon will affect egress and ingress on many local roads. It is much less frustrating when you're prepared.

\*If you park along Ocean Blvd between Livingston Dr and Alamitos Ave, you *should* receive a notice on your car about Sunday. The tow party will begin early Sunday morning, so please move your car.

\*Most major road closures will begin at 5:00am with rolling re-opening times based on location: https://runlongbeach.com/community-relations/. Yes, sometimes the re-openings happen later depending on delayed starts and other factors, so plan for that.

\*I highly recommend not even trying to cross major roads, like Atherton St or Park Ave, anytime before 1:00pm. There will be traffic control letting vehicles through when there are breaks in runners... but it can take a really long time, so just avoid it if possible.

\*There are always questions about 7th Street access. The full marathon route crosses 7th Street at Park Avenue and runners take Park Ave. all the way to Anaheim > Clark > Atherton. If you're trying to get to the 405 / 605 via 7th from North Long Beach, you should plan to take Stearns. Please check the route map for a visual on this.

No. We’re just out of reach for a man who’s built his career off hate, fear, and fake patriotism.

Let’s be clear: Long Beach is not broken.
What’s broken is a country that let a man like Trump rise to power by convincing people that compassion is weakness and greed is freedom.

What’s broken is a government that spends billions militarizing police departments while people in our communities are sleeping in tents and overdosing on curbs.

What’s broken is a billionaire fascist pretending to care about our city while actively working to strip our rights, erase our identities, and drown us in propaganda.

Trump doesn’t care about Long Beach.
He doesn’t care about our unhoused neighbors, our working class, our artists, our students, our families.

He just wants a headline. He wants a soundbite. He wants to turn our real struggles into campaign content.

We are not your campaign ad.
We are not your political football.
We are not your talking point.

We are tired. Tired of the lies. Tired of the gaslighting. Tired of being told we’re the problem when we’re the ones actually fighting to make something better.

You don’t get to call us a disaster when your solution is sending in troops, building walls, banning books, and cutting healthcare.

Trump says he wants to “fix” California?
Nah. He wants to control it.
He wants to break what he can’t understand.

SIZE: This component focuses on quantifying the number of individuals, vehicles, or assets present in the observed area.

  
ACTIVITY: Describing the actions and behavior of the observed entity, the activity component sheds light on the intentions and purpose behind the observed actions. 

  
LOCATION: Providing precise geographical coordinates or a detailed description of the observed target’s location, this component offers the spatial context necessary for effective decision-making. 

  
UNIFORM: Identifying the affiliation or group to which the observed target belongs, the unit component allows intelligence professionals to categorize and contextualize the observed entities. 

  
TIME: Recording the date and time of the observation, the time component adds a temporal dimension to the intelligence gathered.

SORRY
Reggie is scrapping to get by; Mark's playing it fast and loose. A simple meet-up in Long Beach draws in a betrayed husband and two dealer brothers from unrelated worlds. As tensions climb, six people who barely know each other are forced to reckon with loyalty, values, and the price of running with the wrong crowd.

Just when you thought your day couldn’t get any worse, it does. 

Available on the website now!
 You can stream to tv,  all that good stuff. Even got a 5.1 stereo mix in there. 

Ive told my story over the last few months so I don’t want to waste your time with all the little particulars of that, but now, I want to tell you more about the movie.

5.5 months from start to finish, and it was just my wife and I doing the whole thing. While I edited, she was on her computer making sure the IMDB page was getting done, that contracts were signed, and any holes in the boat were patched.  We took on a small studios worth of work and just said fuck it, we got this.  There’s really only way to do it, and that’s to do it, sounds real cliche but damn if it wasn’t the blue print. 

I shot this thing on my iPhone 16 Promax, 5 days, and $938. 
All in Long Beach. Growing up here, it was important to me to capture this place right. 
Hope i did it some justice on the big screen. 
2 days ran sound too, but the other 3 I had my fearless Sidekick, David, operating boom and some mixing, but other than that and occasional BTS, that was the whole crew. Had some amazing actors show up for me, and they crushed it beyond expectations. 

So here we are, the first feature. Imperfect as all hell, and it’s a weird and amazing feeling. Its a dream that just got checked off the list, but its also out in the world and other than asking people to watch it, the things out of my control and that’s a trip. 

Anyways... I really hope someone watches thing and in turn makes a movie of their own.  We’re really trying to start something special here, but it starts with one brick. Sorry is our first brick.

My latest article, ""Think Trump's Mass Deportation Policy Doesn't Affect You in Long Beach, California? Think Again,"" delves into a critical issue that's having a tangible impact right here in our community. For the too-long-did-not-read version you can check out this six minute podcast about the article: [https://youtu.be/5bCb5tuMJXs](https://youtu.be/5bCb5tuMJXs)

Through the story of my dear church sister, Marion, who is 101-years-old and relies on in-home care, the article illustrates the very real consequences of immigration policies on our most vulnerable.

The in-home service industry is heavily dependent on immigrant labor. As of 2022, over 40% of home health aides in California were foreign-born. Latina and Filipina women, like Marion's wonderful aide CeeCee , are the backbone of this essential workforce

When agencies report being ""way understaffed"" and unable to consistently provide caregivers, it directly impacts the quality and availability of care. As an AP News article titled ""Nursing Homes Struggle With Trump’s Immigration Crackdown"" notes, facilities are seeing employees stop coming to work out of fear of raids, and a slowdown of job applicants. This fear has profound implications for our seniors and disabled individuals.

This isn't an abstract political debate; it's about real people, real care needs, and the economic ripple effects that touch us all. We must acknowledge the vital role immigrant workers play in our society.

I invite you to read the full article and join the conversation on this critical issue.

Reddit,beach,Ranked Choice Voting Long Beach - Lets get a Zohran in the LBC!,"Hello everybody.  Sorry to spam this a little bit, but given the historic election of Zohran last night in the ranked choice NYC mayoral race, I figured I would give another plug to our Democratic Socialist of America - Long Beach ranked choice voting push in Long Beach.  Candidates like Zohran Mamdani are only possible in an environment that doesn't artificially moderate our candidates like the current voting system does. Rank choice voting is a method of ballot collection that we believe will fix that. Here's a quick explainer:

* Right now, when you vote in the current system, you pick one candidate and your vote goes only to that candidate. If that candidate is unpopular, your vote is potentially wasted.
* With Ranked Choice Voting, you get to rank candidates in the order that you prefer: 1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, and so on.
* If your first choice can’t win, your vote automatically transfers to your second choice. This means you can vote for the person you like best and not be concerned that you might be wasting your vote.
* It gives voters more voice and more choice and empowers a wider range of candidates to run.
* [Here is a quick explainer video](https://youtu.be/Fiq1xpIE6X8) for New York's ranked choice elections, that function virtually the same as this will.

So here is the ask, we need you to sign a quick petition for ranked choice voting that will help Long Beach adopt this common sense voting method in our future city elections. It only takes about 1 minutes, and would really help **put pressure on city council** to make Long Beach elections fairer and more representative.

Reddit,beach,Ranked Choice Voting Long Beach!,"Hello everybody.  I'm reaching out as a member of your local Democratic Socialists of America - Long Beach ranked choice voting campaign because we need your help!  Rank choice voting is a method of ballot collection that we believe will be fairer to everyone voting.  Here's a quick explainer:

* Right now, when you vote in the current system, you pick one candidate and your vote goes only to that candidate.  If that candidate is unpopular, your vote is potentially wasted.
* With Ranked Choice Voting, you get to rank candidates in the order that you prefer: 1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, and so on.
* If your first choice can’t win, your vote automatically transfers to your second choice. This means you can vote for the person you like best and not be concerned that you might be wasting your vote.
* It gives voters more voice and more choice and empowers a wider range of candidates to run.
* [Here is a quick explainer video](https://youtu.be/Fiq1xpIE6X8) for New York's ranked choice elections, that will function virtually the same as this.

So here is the ask, we need you to sign a quick petition for ranked choice voting that will help Long Beach adopt this common sense voting method in our future city elections.  It only takes about 2 minutes, and would really help put pressure on city council to make Long Beach elections fairer and more representative.

Reddit,beach,Just had the easiest time at Long Beach DMV. Here's how.,"I hate LB DMV but my Real ID expires early June. Can't get an appt until late July.

  
My work is about a 5 min drive to the DMV so I got in virtual line yesterday at 2:30. (Go to DMV website -> Appointments -> Get In Line)  I was #38 in line. I watched my place in line tick down over the next hour. At 3:30 I was #15 in line so I figured my number would be up a little after 4pm. When I was at #10, I left work early at 3:50 and went to the DMV. I also got a text to say to make my way to the entrance.  Here's the best part: you don't wait in line AT ALL. Walk past the non-appointment line and walk past the people in line checking in for their appt. Just walk in and sit down to wait for your number to get called.  I got called up at about 4:15 or so. Easy peasy.

  
Also, the parking lot there is way too small for the amount of people they are serving. You will circle around and there are no spots. Park around the corner on Grand Ave in front the the LB health building. It's a 2 block walk but way less stress. 

I basically spent about 20 minutes in the DVM, got my RealID renewed and it was a breeze. I feel like I got away with something! If you have a morning or afternoon off and were planning on spending hours in the DMV, get in the online line and at least wait out the hours at home or in a coffee shop. 

The DMV sucks. Hope this helps someone reduce their frustration with the process.

Walk past the non-appointment line and walk past the people in line checking in for their appt. Just walk in and sit down to wait for your number to get called.  I got called up at about 4:15 or so. Easy peasy.

  
Also, the parking lot there is way too small for the amount of people they are serving. You will circle around and there are no spots. Park around the corner on Grand Ave in front the the LB health building. It's a 2 block walk but way less stress. 

I basically spent about 20 minutes in the DVM, got my RealID renewed and it was a breeze. I feel like I got away with something! If you have a morning or afternoon off and were planning on spending hours in the DMV, get in the online line and at least wait out the hours at home or in a coffee shop. 

The DMV sucks. Hope this helps someone reduce their frustration with the process. ",-0.045568783068783064,0.37037037037037035,Neutral
Reddit,beach,"That Long Beach indie movie update, with free rentals. The","I have to start off by saying THANK YOU for all the support, the roll out of this movie online has been nothing short then a rough road, but people watching, and supporting, makes it all worth it. 

And I don’t really know how to show my appreciation other than typing, so in the comments below Im gonna put a promo code for a free rental. If you need something to watch tonight, I got you covered! 
The code will be good for 15 people to use, first come first gets it. 

The roll out: 9.25 got the movie up for a midnight release. Everything seemed cool, knocked out for the night. Then the call, my editor homie said the audio was all smashed to the Left side, what!?!??? 
18 hours later, figured out, only to get the new fixed stereo mix trigger copyright warnings and the movie was taken down temporarily. For some reason, the page was disabled altogether. 
So I start a new separate page. 
The wrong file gets uploaded, output banking (black bars) alllll wonky, etc. 
get a new copy replaced asap. In the mean time, monitor hub burns out, main monitor starts to go out completely, eventually does, but good news is got the movie up and it’s finally going smoothly. 

With that being said. If you did rent or rent or purchase between 9.25 and 9.27  and the moves not available to you, shoot me a message on here with your receipt and I’ll get you a code for a new one. 

Also, some context for this movie. I shot it by myself with no crew, no budget, in 5.5 months. My wife produced it, and we’ve been doing everything else under the sun to get this thing done and out. The wanting to make a feature vs shorts and music videos was eating me alive and needed to get a product out. 
Now, we gotta get some people to see it. 
I present to you, my Long Beach movie, SORRY. 

Reggie's broke, Mark's reckless. A routine Long Beach day spins out when a betrayed husband and two dealer brothers crash their Tinder meet-up, tangling six strangers in consequences they can't shake.

Just when you thought your day couldn’t get any worse, it does.

Reddit,beach,Long Beach pastor being investigated for possession of child porn,"A Long Beach pastor is being investigated for possession of child pornography, the Long Beach Police Department has confirmed.

On Sept. 9, child abuse detectives were made aware that Jeff Zabel, 50, had admitted to viewing child pornography, according to the Long Beach Police Department. Detectives arranged a meeting with Zabel, who was taken into custody after the interview, the department said.

Zabel was booked on one count of possession of child pornography and later “released on his own recognizance,” according to the department, which added the investigation is ongoing.

Arbor Road Church leadership declined to answer questions from the Watchdog, but Lead Pastors Brent Eldridge and Alan Kim emailed members about the situation.

In their Sept. 11 email obtained by the Watchdog, the pastors explained that they were made aware of a “concerning moral failure in the life” of Zabel on Sept. 8. The following day, church leadership met with Zabel.

Zabel, who had been employed as the pastor of worship and service production since June 2008, resigned on the spot, the pastors said. Zabel also was removed from his role as a music teacher at Lakewood Christian School, which occupies the same facility as Arbor Road Church.

During the church’s two services Sunday, Zabel was alluded to but was not mentioned by name.

Eldridge noted major events that have happened recently, including the slaying of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska last month; school shootings; 9/11 memorials; the killing of far-right political commentator Charlie Kirk, known for his divisive debates and ideas that many considered racist, misogynistic, xenophobic and homophobic; and, “of course, everything that we’ve been walking through around here at Arbor Road.”

Later in the services, Kim led church-goers in a prayer, during which he prayed for Kirk, a white Christian nationalist, and his family.

“We thank you for Charlie Kirk's life,” Kim said. “He was a man of faith, bold about his beliefs. And I just pray that you would continue to help us to be a church that is bold.”

Kim’s prayer did not include mention of Zabel or his family.

thanks for SHOWING UP yesterday, long beach. together with 18,999 others, i ran the half on a beautiful not too hot morning and **the crowd support was ROBUST**.

what i love most is the diversity of runners and the range of supporters. this is a race for ALL types of runners from ALL types of communities. so many families out there cheering first-time racers. so many running clubs representing from all over LA county, orange county, san bernadino, ventura, etc... good job! 

the course has great stretches for runners to push through gauntlets of noise makers, drummers, the confetti cannons… passing by volunteers who manage the water stations as well as help with the cleanup. the bands playing. the folks in their beach chairs. the one-person cheering sections as well as the roar of the crowd near the finish line on shoreline drive. 

it’s a community event that welcomes so many new runners. as someone who’s run this race for years, i think long beach marathon races are the very first marathon or first half-marathon for many of its participants, which makes it a terrific and supportive entry-level race experience. i’m not sure locals are aware of their city’s unique place in southern california running culture.

i definitely think the city leaders don’t fully appreciate it and are missing opportunities to turn this race into an annual running festival, as other cities do. GO LARGE, long beach. you run in other city marathons and all along the route, there are banners, there are welcome signs. there’s a sustained awareness campaign with promotions so the city as a whole gets a chance to be in on the event… look at san diego's event, LA, NYC, even small towns like duluth, minnesota... they CELEBRATE it but you don’t see much of that here in long beach, even as the city gears up for **LA 28**. you could be standing in east village, three blocks from the route, and have no idea. 

however, the top-level support from the many running clubs makes up for a lot of that and the loud and enthusiastic crowds turn this event into a positive and transformational experience for many of its runners… so THANKS long beach! ❤️❤️❤️

Hey everyone, Adreana here. As a Long Beach resident, I've been deeply concerned about the future of public education. I recently released a podcast episode where my co-host Alison and I break down how a potential Trump administration's policies could affect our students, especially those with special needs.

We discuss Project 2025's blueprint to ""eliminate the Department of Education"" and its proposed transfer of special education programs to the Department of Health and Human Services. Experts fear this would promote a ""medical model of disability"" , shifting crucial support away from schools and creating significant challenges for families.

The good news is, we have a local opportunity to get informed and take action. My church, First Congregational Church of Long Beach, is hosting an Education Forum on

**Sunday, August 17, 2025, at 11:30 AM**. The main speaker will be Dr. Tiffany Brown, the Deputy Superintendent of the Long Beach Unified School District. She will be there to discuss how we can support our students in the face of these attacks.

The event is in the Koinonia Room at 241 Cedar Ave, Long Beach, CA 90802. There's also a Zoom option if you can't make it in person.

You can listen to the full podcast episode here:

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. How do you think these policies will affect our schools here in Long Beach?

Hey everyone, Adreana here. As a Long Beach resident, I've been deeply concerned about the future of public education. I recently released a podcast episode where my co-host Alison and I break down how a potential Trump administration's policies could affect our students, especially those with special needs.

We discuss Project 2025's blueprint to ""eliminate the Department of Education"" and its proposed transfer of special education programs to the Department of Health and Human Services. Experts fear this would promote a ""medical model of disability"" , shifting crucial support away from schools and creating significant challenges for families.

The good news is, we have a local opportunity to get informed and take action. My church, First Congregational Church of Long Beach, is hosting an Education Forum on

**Sunday, August 17, 2025, at 11:30 AM**. The main speaker will be Dr. Tiffany Brown, the Deputy Superintendent of the Long Beach Unified School District. She will be there to discuss how we can support our students in the face of these attacks.

The event is in the Koinonia Room at 241 Cedar Ave, Long Beach, CA 90802. There's also a Zoom option if you can't make it in person.

You can listen to the full podcast episode here:

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. How do you think these policies will affect our schools here in Long Beach?

I was born and raised in Los Alamitos in the 90’s-00’s, now based in Brooklyn, and I’m coming home for a memorial with my husband, who’s never been to CA. I want to show him around my old childhood stomping grounds in Long Beach, namely Belmont Shore and downtown Long Beach, but those were my teenage years so I never really got to explore the arts or nightlife of Long Beach.

We like chill artsy vibes vs. clubby, and we’re in our mid-30’s. But feel free to throw out any suggestions and I can do additional research. Right now the only one I found is Halo rooftop.

Reddit,downtown,Car Towed from Lot B (Downtown Long Beach) Without Notice – Anyone Else Dealt with This?,"I live in the apartment building right next to Lot B (on 4th & Pine in downtown Long Beach) and pay monthly to park there. My car hasn’t been driven in a couple months because I’ve been trying to get it to pass smog, and in the meantime the battery died. It’s been parked properly in the same spot the whole time — not blocking anything or violating any signage.

I had someone scheduled to come replace the battery this week and had even arranged for a car wash. But today I went to check on it and found out it had been towed to LB Tow Yard — with no notice or warning at all. Now I’m being told I have to pay nearly $500 to get it back.

I’m super frustrated and confused. I’ve been paying for this spot the whole time every month. Has anyone else had this happen in Lot B or in other city-managed lots? What’s the point of paying monthly for parking if my car will be towed?

Reddit,downtown,How many of you have firsthand experience with a shooting? Or know a friend who has?,"I’m curious if it’s just the neighborhood I’m in or it’s just my luck, or if this comes with the territory lol.

I moved to downtown Long Beach a year and a half ago and have already been one degree removed from a shooting witness, and have been a witness myself.

One was my roommate. She works at Long Beach rescue mission and saw a shootout happen first-hand. It was in broad daylight while she was at work Literally the gun was shooting in her direction against one of the residents.

One was while I driving home super late at night, like 2 or 3am. I was crossing the bridge on Anaheim right off the 710 when a white pickup truck pulls just ahead of me. Suddenly there’s a splintering loud pop and the back window of the pickup truck shatters. I speed up to drive ahead of them and when I get home, I notice a bullet hole in the side of my car, right above my rear tire.

To this day I have no idea what their goal was. I don’t know why they didn’t continue pursuing me. Maybe that bridge was the perfect spot to try to pop my tire and rob me? But why would they shoot through their own back window?

That makes me wonder if there was another car I didn’t see that actually shot at them? But the trajectory of the bullet hole in my car lines up with the position the pickup truck was in.

Ever since having those experiences, I’ve started noticing more stories of shootouts and killings in the local news. But at the same time, my neighbors tell me that downtown LB has gotten better over the years lol (it used to be worse? What??)

So my question is—is this a normal part of long beach life? Do you have any stories yourself? Have you seen gun violence decrease or worsen over the years? I grew up in Vietnam so I’m not used to this. I’ve seen all the American gun memes but didn’t know how real it was lol.

I am sharing the news and my review about the new food spot on 4th Street in Downtown Long Beach is NOW OPEN to the community after months of construction, paperwork process and staff training! 

I know we all have been waiting and wondering when the grand opening is. It just passed and the place is amazingly beautiful and spectacular! Everyone is very friendly, welcoming and it’s nothing but good vibes at this location. 

There’s indoor and outdoor spaces to dine. Pets are welcome, there’s disability accessibility and you will get served some of the finest seafood I ever had the pleasure to eat. You can enjoy your meal while listening to music, watching a game or simply savoring your dish. Their time is precise on the orders, they have vegetarian options and it’s a great place to grab a meal after a nice workout around the area or before a concert nearby. 
I highly suggest you come visit Fishbone and say hello to the kind staff and the wonderful owner, Greg. When you’re here, you’re more than likely to return for that second bite!

Reddit,downtown,"Yes, I AM the old lady in Long Beach","And just to prove how old I am, not 7 days after posting about how much I hate the sound of those mini bikes I am going to post another bitch about sounds in downtown Long Beach. 

Specifically, 24 Hour Fitness in downtown Long Beach. The staff here is very friendly and helpful. They are always good about greeting everyone who comes in with a smile.

But you know what else often greets me? Rap music from a large karaoke speaker that sits at the front desk. Rap music, so what, right?

Yes, so what, but often it is rap music with words like bitch, pussy, fuck and talking about murdering people with guns.

Listen, I am not talking about whether the music is good or bad. Rap is like any other genre of music. Some of it is brilliant and some of it sucks ass. 

What I am talking about is that the music that is appropriate to blare from the speaker at a gym that toutes itself as family friendly (not this one but many 24 Hour Fitness gyms have childcare) is different than the music that is appropriate at a Long Beach themed hip hop clothing store with graffitti as part of the display in the window.

The music corporate 24 Hour Fitness plays on its custom music video channel on the tv screens all over the gym should be, in my opinion, as spicy as it gets.

Honestly I do not know why they play music AT ALL. The overwhelming majority of people I see when I visit ANY 24 Hour Fitness have on personal listening devices be they earbuds or headphones.

Long time lurker on the sub and first time poster.

I first moved to Long Beach to go to CSULB for college and then proceeded to live there for some time after I graduated. Two years ago I moved to Venice for a job that I couldn’t really pass up because it was that good for my career and boy let me tell you I really do miss Long Beach so much.

I really took for granted the community I built there and the rapport I have built with all the businesses in the area of my apartment. I used to run into people that I knew constantly in my neighborhood just going on walks.

Where I live now is so isolating and doesn’t have that charm at all. I really can’t even put my finger on it but Long Beach just feels like home.

That being said I am already starting to look for opportunities to move back hopefully within the year lol.

All that to say, Long Beach has its issues but I have yet to live in the place with more charm and down to earth people that I really didn’t appreciate it until moving. I will keep lurking on the sub until I’m back. lol

TL;DR moved out of Long Beach for a career opportunity only to realize that I hate it here and there is really no place like Long Beach.

So, I f***ed up by “staying” at this place, I use the term staying loosely as my family and I didn’t last 24 hours, we checked in at 3PM and was out by 1:45PM the next day. 

-The front gate was propped open with a paver and the building was advertised as secure
- The game table is broken and missing pieces 
-I almost provided my child with a broken glass to drink out of, there was a deep crack in it
-The apartment lacked circulation, my child and I ended up with a nose bleed due to the heat.
-The TV was broken in the main bedroom, only found that out after I turned it on.
-One of the blinds was broken in the smaller bedroom
-The host asked you to respect the quiet hours for the sake of the neighbors but the neighbors kept family up until 3-4AM. You name the noise, they made it.
-They requested no smoking which was fine, but once again the neighbors sat outside right next door smoking
-The neighbors also blocked the stairs on the side nearest the apartment we were in. Not a major deal breaker, there was another side to go down but like WTF?! 😒

Long story short, the area was fine, it’s Long Beach I’m not bothered by much in that regard. I do feel like I should have taken my family to a hotel and just paid the extra $200 because one or two issues I can deal with, but several? NO.

It's driving me and my poor dog nuts! We rely on dog door access + dog walker for her when we're working longer days in office. Do we just need to close the door til this season subsides and increase dog walker cadence?",0.11220238095238096,0.5476190476190476,Positive

Reddit,neighborhood,Mazzlyn the pit bull making ‘good progress’ two weeks after being stabbed,"A 5-year-old dog is still recovering two weeks after being stabbed when her owner and his friends were approached by a man with a knife in the North Alamitos Beach neighborhood.

The young pit bull named Mazzlyn is on the mend, according to Fix Long Beach co-owner Sherri Stankewitz. But recovery could take months and it remains unclear if she will ever fully heal, Stankewitz added.

Candice Woodend, 43, and her husband, who are unhoused, were visiting with friends at the apartment building at 333 Orange Avenue in the early morning of Aug. 2. She stayed behind to cook the group hot dogs, but was interrupted when her husband burst back into the apartment in a panic and told her Mazzlyn had been stabbed.

“My mind was racing. I was in shock,” Woodend told the Watchdog. “As soon as I saw her, I was crying and freaking out. She was definitely fighting to live.”

The victims and at least one witness, who lives in the building and took video of the attack, say the suspect was angry that unhoused people were near the building. The man approached the group brandishing a large knife, they said.

The group lost hold of Mazzlyn who then charged the man, who in turn swiped at the dog with the knife numerous times, video shows. The man then fled in a car with another person, the witnesses say.

The victims and witness allege the attacker also lives at 333 Orange Ave. and has a history of being aggressive and threatening to strangers. They said they know his name and apartment number as well as the license plate number of the car he drove off in, all of which have been provided to the Long Beach Police Department.

“Detectives are actively pursuing all leads in this investigation,” LBPD spokesperson Alyssa Baeza said in an email.

The dog has been convalescing at Fix Long Beach for over a week.

“Mazzy’s doing better. She had a little bit of infection,” Stankewitz said, noting that the incision site looks small but it was deep and the knife was likely dirty. “She has a little bit of nerve damage in her front right paw.”

The pup is going through physical therapy, Stankewitz said, and there is only about a 50-50 chance for a full recovery. But the “doctor has hope because she’s made some good progress in the last week,” she added.

I’ve got a car that’s picked up a few dents and small paint scratches from street parking (life in the downtown neighborhood, right?). I’m not looking to replace parts or do a full body shop job; just something cheap to make it look a little better.

Description
Lou Rosen and Molly Hatch are unlicensed private detectives, scraping by on whatever cases they can get from their little office on the fringes of LA County.

Reeling from a devastating betrayal and a major earthquake, this season finds Lou and Molly trying to rebuild their lives and evaluate their futures. But those futures might not be as long as they hope.

Lou and Molly start what appears to be a quiet case: a series of strange home break-ins all involving ex-employees of a defunct Long Beach stereo manufacturer. But this case will quickly bring them up against an opponent more ruthless and resourceful than they've ever faced before. Lou and Molly have always gotten by on their wits, but what to do when facing an enemy who can outmatch them in both wits and violence?

A cat and mouse game through the forgotten regions of Southern California, including a shady direct-to-video movie studio, the unglamorous workers neighborhoods of glamorous Catalina Island, and the distant remote parts of the desert, where help cannot reach you in time.

Reddit,neighborhood,Photo project in obca south La and cpt,"

Hi everyone,

I'm planning a trip to LA as part of a personal photography project I've been working on, documenting locations connected to hip-hop history. I’ve done something similar in New York (happy to share examples if anyone’s interested — not trying to promote myself), and now I’d love to photograph places like the former site of the Marathon Store, the old VIP Records spot in Long Beach, Watts Towers, hip-hop murals, and some music video locations around South LA, Compton, and Long Beach. I’m also a car enthusiast, so I’d love to catch some lowriders in action if possible.

I want to emphasize that I’m not trying to photograph people (unless someone wants to be involved), and I absolutely respect people's privacy, space, and communities. I’m aware that these aren’t tourist attractions, and I don’t want to be intrusive or disrespectful in any way. I understand some neighborhoods might not appreciate outsiders walking around with cameras, and I’m trying to avoid doing anything that would make anyone uncomfortable.

The reason I’m asking here is because I’ve seen a lot of conflicting takes on Reddit — some say it’s totally fine if you’re respectful, others say it could be risky no matter what. I’m a bit confused and really want to get input from locals or people familiar with the area.

If you have any tips, insights, or suggestions on how to go about this the right way, I’d truly appreciate it. Thanks!

Hi everyone,

I'm planning a trip to LA as part of a personal photography project I've been working on, documenting locations connected to hip-hop history. I’ve done something similar in New York (happy to share examples if anyone’s interested — not trying to promote myself), and now I’d love to photograph places like the former site of the Marathon Store, the old VIP Records spot in Long Beach, Watts Towers, hip-hop murals, and some music video locations around South LA, Compton, and Long Beach. I’m also a car enthusiast, so I’d love to catch some lowriders in action if possible.

I want to emphasize that I’m not trying to photograph people (unless someone wants to be involved), and I absolutely respect people's privacy, space, and communities. I’m aware that these aren’t tourist attractions, and I don’t want to be intrusive or disrespectful in any way. I understand some neighborhoods might not appreciate outsiders walking around with cameras, and I’m trying to avoid doing anything that would make anyone uncomfortable.
