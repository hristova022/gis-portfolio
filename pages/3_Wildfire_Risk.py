    ### Why This Analysis Matters
    
    Southern California has **8 major wildfire risk zones** - areas where fires happen repeatedly. 
    
    This map shows **WHERE** the risk is highest and **WHY** each area is dangerous.
    
    **Three main factors create extreme fire risk:**
    1. **Geography** - Mountains and canyons that channel winds and make fires spread uphill rapidly
    2. **Weather** - Hot, dry Santa Ana winds that can push fires at speeds up to 100 mph
    3. **Where homes are built** - Communities built directly in fire-prone wildlands with only one or two roads out
    
    When homes are built in canyons, on hillsides, or surrounded by brush and forests, they become part of the 
    fuel that fires burn. This is called the "Wildland-Urban Interface" - the dangerous zone where neighborhoods 
    meet wildland. **These areas have the highest property loss when fires occur.**

    ### What Is the Wildland-Urban Interface?
    
    The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) is where houses and wildland vegetation meet. Think of it as the 
    "edge" where neighborhoods bump up against forests, brush, and canyons.
    
    **Why It's Dangerous:**
    
    In these areas, your home becomes part of the fuel:
    - **Embers travel** - Wind-blown embers can land on wood decks, in gutters, or near fences
    - **Radiant heat** - The heat from nearby burning vegetation can ignite your home before flames arrive
    - **Continuous fuel** - Brush touching your fence, trees over your roof create a path for fire
    
    **Real Examples from Southern California:**
    
    - **Paradise Fire (2018)** - 85 people died, mostly trapped on evacuation routes with only 1-2 exits
    - **Woolsey Fire (2018, Malibu)** - Homes built in canyons with wooden decks burned when embers landed
    - **Holy Fire (2018, Orange County)** - Hillside homes with no defensible space lost, while those with cleared space survived
    
    **The Pattern:** Communities built in beautiful canyons and hillsides look amazing, but they're built 
    in the exact places that fires naturally burn. Add strong winds, and fires move faster than people can evacuate.

    **How Communities Are Built:**
    - **Homes in Wildlands** - Built directly in or next to fire-prone brush and forests
    - **Narrow Canyon Roads** - Only one or two ways out, creating evacuation bottlenecks  
    - **Wooden Decks & Roofs** - Construction materials that catch embers easily

# Simple methodology
with st.expander("‚ÑπÔ∏è How We Calculated Risk"):

    ### Simple Risk Scoring
    
    Each zone's risk score is based on:
    
    - **Past Fires** (30%) - Has it burned before?
    - **Weather** (25%) - Is it in a Santa Ana wind zone?
    - **Vegetation** (20%) - How much dry brush and trees?
    - **Communities** (15%) - How many homes are there?
    - **Access** (10%) - Can firefighters get there easily?
    
    **Data Sources:**
    - CAL FIRE (California fire history)
    - County records (home counts)
    - NOAA (weather patterns)
    - Local fire departments
    
    **Important:** Risk scores show probability and impact, but they can't predict 
    exactly when or where a fire will start. Weather and human actions also matter.
